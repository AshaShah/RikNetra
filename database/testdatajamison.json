Agni, to be invoked by ancient sages and by the present ones— he will carry the gods here to this place. By Agni one will obtain wealth and prosperity every day, glorious and richest in heroes. O Agni, the sacrifice and rite that you surround on every side— it alone goes among the gods. Agni, the Hotar with a poet’s purpose, the real one possessing the brightest fame, will come as a god with the gods. When truly you will do good for the pious man, o Agni, just that of yours is real, o Aṅgiras. We approach you, o Agni, illuminator in the evening, every day with our insight, bringing homage— (You), ruling over the rites, the shining herdsman of the truth, growing strong in your own home.

Your exhilarating drinks have united with Indra accompanied by the Maruts and with the kingly Ādityas. And this beaker of the god Tvaṣṭar new produced you made again into four.

Let the goddesses, Wives of superior men [=gods], attend upon us greatly with help, with shelter—those with unclipped wings.

Let the gods help us from there whence Viṣṇu strode out from the earth through the seven domains. Viṣṇu strode out this (world); three times he laid down a step: (this world) is concentrated in his dusty (step). He strode three steps, Viṣṇu the undeceivable cowherd, founding the foundations from there— Behold the deeds of Viṣṇu: from (the place) where he watches over the commandments, the partner in yoke with Indra, That is the highest footstep of Viṣṇu. The patrons always behold it stretched out like the eye [=sun] in heaven. That do the inspired poets, admiring and wakeful, kindle— the highest footstep of Viṣṇu."

Pūṣan the glowing has found the king [=Agni], hidden, laid in hiding, with his glittering ritual grass.

Those (waters) yonder that are close to the sun, or with whom the sun is— let them propel our rite. The goddess Waters do I call upon. Wherever our cows drink, to the rivers an oblation is to be made. Within the waters is deathlessness, in the waters healing, and (it is right) to glorify the waters. O gods, become prizewinners. “Within the waters,” Soma said to me, “are all healing remedies, and Agni who is weal to all.” And the waters are healing for all. O Waters, fully grant healing and protection for my body and (for me) to see the sun for a long time. O Waters, carry this away, whatever trouble is in me— whether I have committed deceit or I have cursed—as well as untruth. O Waters, today I have followed (you). We have united with your sap.

A steer who tried to be the measure of a bull, Vr̥tra lay there, flung apart in many places. *Delivering themselves to Manu, the waters go over him like a split reed—lying in that way. Those very ones whom Vr̥tra in his greatness once surrounded—at their feet lay the serpent. The strength of Vr̥tra’s mother ebbed; Indra bore his weapon down upon her. The mother was above; the son below: Dānu lies like a milk-cow with her calf. In the middle of the turning posts of the never-standing, never-resting (waters), his body sank down. The waters move widely over the private parts of Vr̥tra. He whose rival was Indra lay there in the long darkness (of death). The waters stood still—their husband was the Dāsa; their herdsman, the serpent—hemmed in like the cows by the Paṇi. What was the hidden opening for the waters—that Indra uncovered after he smashed Vr̥tra. You, Indra, then became the tail of a horse when he struck his fangs at you—you, the god alone. You conquered the cows, and, o champion, you conquered the soma. You set loose the seven rivers to flow. Neither the lightning nor the thunder, neither the mist nor the hail that he scattered repelled (Indra) for him. When Indra and the serpent fought each other, the generous one achieved victory also for (all) later times. Whom did you see, Indra, as the avenger of the serpent when fear came into your heart after you smashed him, and when you crossed over the ninety-nine flowing rivers, like a frightened falcon through the airy realms? Bearing the mace in his arms, Indra is the king of him who travels and of him who is settled, of the horned and the hornless. And just he alone as king rules over the different peoples: like a rim the spokes of a wheel, he encompasses those."

      "text": "Come on! Let us go up close to Indra, seeking cattle. Will he increase his solicitude for us? With no one to hinder him, will he perhaps then turn his distant intention toward us for this wealth, for cattle? I fly close to the unopposable giver of wealth, like a falcon to its delightful dwelling, doing homage to Indra with my best chants, the one who is to be invoked by praisers on his journey. Fully armed, he has laden himself down with quivers; he herds together the cows of the stranger, of whomever he wishes to. Keep poking out valuable things in abundance, Indra—don’t be a niggard, (at a distance) from us, you strengthened one. For you smashed the wealthy Dasyu with your deadly weapon, going it alone, (though accompanied) by your assistants [=Maruts?], Indra. From the high plain they went apart in opposite directions; the non-sacrificing old codgers made their departure. They just twisted their heads off, Indra—the non-sacrificers contending with the sacrificers. O strong horse-possessing (chariot-)mounter, when (you came) forth from heaven, you blasted those who follow no commandment in the two world-halves. They wished to battle the army of the faultless one; the Navagva peoples marshaled themselves. Like castrated bullocks battling with a bull, they seemed to go away from Indra along slippery slopes. You set them to fighting, those wailing and those laughing, on the far edge of the dusky realm, Indra. From heaven on high you sent fire burning down on the Dasyu; you favored the recitation of the presser and the praiser. Having made for themselves a girdle from the earth, adorning themselves with a golden amulet, (though) urging themselves on, they did not overtake Indra. He clothed his spies with the sun. When, Indra, you coiled around both worlds on all sides with your greatness, (you blasted) at the heedless ones with (the aid of) those who pay heed; you blasted forth the Dasyu with (the aid of) those who create sacred formulations, o Indra— (The Dasyu) who did not reach the end of heaven, of earth, who did not hem in the wealth-giving (Indra) with their magical wiles. The bull Indra made his mace his yokemate. He milked the cows out of the darkness with light. In accord with his autonomous power the waters flowed; he grew strong in the middle of the navigable ones. With a single-minded thought, with a most powerful blow Indra smashed him [=Vr̥tra?] to high heavens. He pierced down through the fastnesses of Ilībiśa; he split apart horned Śuṣṇa—Indra. As much endurance, as much strength (as remained to you), bounteous one, (using that,) with your mace you smashed the rival who sought battle. Goal-directed, he set out against his rivals; with the sharp bull he split apart the strongholds. He made Vr̥tra collide with his mace—Indra. He advanced his own thinking, exulting all the while. You aided Kutsa, Indra, in whom you took pleasure; you furthered the bull Daśadyu as he did battle. Stirred up by hooves, the dust reached heaven. Śvaitreya stood up to conquer the superior men. You aided the hornless bull in the Tugriyan (battles), the Śvitriyan cow at the conquering of dwelling places, bounteous one. They have made a long delay, just staying here. You have laid low the possessions of those who behave as rivals."

The peoples have installed Agni, the increaser of might. Bringing oblations, we would do honor to you. Become today our benevolent helper here when prizes (are at stake), o comrade. We choose you as messenger, as the Hotar who affords all possessions. Since you are great, your flames range widely; your radiant beams touch heaven. The gods Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman kindle you, their primordial messenger. With you, o Agni, that one wins every stake—the mortal who ritually serves you. You are the delighting Hotar, the lord of the household, and the messenger of the clans. In you are gathered together all the enduring commandments that the gods made. Just in you who bring good fortune is every oblation poured, o youngest Agni. Benevolent toward us today and in the future, sacrifice to the gods for masses of good heroes. Bringing homage, they reverently approach him, their sovereign king, just so. With their oblations the sons of Manu kindle Agni, after they have crossed beyond failures. Smashing their Vr̥tra [/obstacle], they crossed over the two world-halves and the waters and made for themselves a wide place for peaceful dwelling. The bull [=Agni], brilliant when bepoured, came to be at Kaṇva’s side; the horse [=Agni] whinnied at the cattle-raids. Sit together (with us): you are great. Blaze as the best at pursuing the gods. Let loose your beautiful red smoke in every direction, o lauded Agni, partaker of the ritual meal— Whom the gods installed here for Manu as the best sacrificer, o conveyor of the oblation, whom Kaṇva (and?) Medhyātithi (installed) as the winner of stakes, whom Vr̥ṣan [/the bull], whom Upastuta [/the praised] (installed). Agni whom Medhyātithi (and?) Kaṇva kindled from truth, his are the refreshments that shine forth; him do these verses (make strong) and him, Agni, do we make strong. Give fullness of wealth, o autonomous one, for you have friendship among the gods, o Agni. You rule over a prize worthy of fame. Have mercy on us: you are great. Stand upright to help us, like god Savitar, upright as the winner of the prize when we vie with (other) cantors with their ornaments in invoking (you). Upright, protect us from narrow straits with your beacon. Burn up every devourer. Make us upright to move and to live. Find favor for us among the gods. Protect us from the demon, o Agni. Protect us from the malice of the enemy. Protect from the man who does harm or who seeks to smash us, o youngest one with lofty beams. As if with a deadly weapon, smash asunder our enemies and whoever deceives us, o you of scorching fangs. The mortal who sharpens himself throughout the nights, let that cheat not be master of us. Agni gained good heroes en masse, and Agni good fortune for Kaṇva. Agni helped Medhyātithi—as did Mitra (and Varuṇa) [/the two allies]— and Agni (helped) Upastuta in winning. With Agni we call Turvaśa and Yadu from afar, also Ugrādeva. Agni, our force against the Dasyu, led Navavāstva of the lofty chariots and Turvīti. Manu installed you, Agni, to be a light for the people, each and every one. Born of truth, you shine when grown strong [/sprinkled] in the company of Kaṇva—(you) to whom the communities bring reverence. The dazzling, hard-charging flames of Agni, terrifying like (wild beasts), are not to be confronted. (Burn) the demonic forces, the sorcerers forever—burn up every devourer."

The inspired poets have installed you as their Hotar, seasonably sacrificing, best finder of goods, with listening ears, of greatest extent, o Agni, at the rituals of daybreak. The inspired poets whose soma is pressed have roused you to delight— they bearing the lofty light, the oblation for the pious mortal, o Agni. O might-made comrade, those who travel early for soma-drinking, the divine folk—here today make them sit on the ritual grass, o good one. The divine folk, o Agni, attract toward us through sacrifice, with invocations common (to all): “Here is the soma, you of good drops. Drink it, aged overnight.”"

Liberality, impelling (him), mounted to him of a hundred resolves. You opened up the cowpen for the Aṅgirases, and you were the way-finder for Atri in the (house) of a hundred doors. You also conveyed the good thing [=wife?] to Vimada along with grain (for the oblation?), when in the contest you set to dancing the stone of the one clad in it. You opened up the covers of the waters; you held fast to the drop-laden goods in the mountain. When, o Indra, with your vast power you smashed the serpent Vr̥tra, just after that you made the sun rise in heaven to be seen. With your wiles you blew away the wily ones, who, according to their own customs, poured (their offering) “on the shoulder.” You broke through the strongholds of Pipru, o you of manly mind; you helped R̥ jiśvan through in the smashing of Dasyus. You helped Kutsa in the smashing of Śuṣṇa, and you made Śambara subject to Atithigva. With your foot you trampled down Arbuda, though he was great. Indeed, from long ago you were born to smash Dasyus. In you every power has been placed toward the same end. Your generosity excites itself to drink the soma. Your mace has become visible, placed in your arms: hew down the bullish strengths of your rival. Distinguish between the Āryas and those who are Dasyus. Chastising those who follow no commandment, make them subject to the man who provides ritual grass. Become the potent inciter of the sacrificer. I take pleasure in all these (deeds) of yours at our joint revelries. Indra—making those who reject his commandments subject to those who follow his commandments, piercing those who don’t stand by him with (the aid of) those who do— being praised, as an ant he smashed apart the mud walls of the one trying to reach heaven, who, though already full grown, kept growing. When Uśanā fashions might with might for you, then your vast power thrusts apart the two worlds with its greatness. The mind-yoked (horses) of the Wind conveyed you, being filled (with soma?), here to fame, o manly minded one. When he has found exhilaration together with Uśanā Kāvya, Indra mounts the two (horses) that are surging and surging further.

You mount the chariot to the bullish drinks on which you become exhilarated at Śāryata’s (ritual) presentation, so that you will take pleasure in (the ceremonies) with their pressed soma, o Indra. (Then) you ascend to the unassailing signal call in heaven. You gave little Vr̥cayā to great, eloquent Kakṣīvant, the soma-presser, o Indra. You became the wife of Vr̥ṣaṇaśva, o you of good resolve. All these (deeds) of yours are to be proclaimed at the pressings. Indra has become fixed in the exclusive possession of the man of good insight; the praise song (has been fixed) like a doorpost among the Pajras, as it seeks horses, cows, chariots, and goods. Indra alone is master of wealth and will provide it. This homage has been pronounced for the bull, the independent king, the mighty one of real unbridled force.

Like a mountain, immovable on its foundations, Indra, with his thousand forms of help, grew strong amid his powers, when subduing the floods, highly excited by the soma stalk, he smashed Vr̥tra, who obstructed the rivers. For he (was) a skulker among skulkers at the maw (of Vr̥tra?), but he, having a golden foundation, was strengthened to exhilaration at the (soma-)udder by the inspired thinkers [=Maruts?]— Indra—with my skillful work and insight I have summoned him whose gifts are most generous, for he is a provider because of the soma stalk. Him whom they fill like the sea—his own superior powers of good essence which have the ritual grass as their seat in heaven— Indra—his forms of help [=helpers] stood by him at the Vr̥tra-smashing, as did his unextinguishable gusts whose breath is unobstructed. In his exhilaration, while he was fighting, his forms of help rushed to him, who has his own proper work, like rapids in a torrent, when the mace-wielding Indra, emboldened by the soma stalk, split the barricades of the Vala cave, as Trita had. Glowing heat encircles him [=Indra], and his vast power flared. He [=Vr̥tra], having obstructed the waters, was lying on the foundation of the dusky realm, when you, Indra, struck your thunder down upon the jaws of Vr̥tra, Hard-to-Grasp, in the (waters’) torrent. For like waves to a lake, the sacred formulations that make you strong rush down to you, o Indra. Tvaṣṭar also strengthened his own power, to be employed by you: he fashioned the mace of overwhelming might. And when you, o Indra of concentrated resolve, together with your fallow bays, smashed Vr̥tra, making a way for the waters for Manu, you held the metal mace in your arms. You fixed the sun fast in heaven to be seen. What is lofty, self-luminous, formidable, and praiseworthy [=Indra in form of sun]—in fear they made that their own means of ascent to heaven, when the forms of help appropriate to human prize-contests, (that is,) the Maruts, accompanying that superior man [=Indra], cheered on Indra, their sun. Even formidable heaven kept retreating from the sound of this serpent and in fear at your mace, Indra, when, in the exhilaration of the pressed soma, with your vast power you split the head of Vr̥tra, who was pressing harder and harder upon the two world-halves. Now, o Indra, just as far as the earth with its ten coils (extends) and the separate peoples will extend throughout all the days, just to there, o bounteous one, your widely famed strength will pervade heaven with vast power and mightiness. O you of bold mind, at the far edge of this dusky realm and of distant heaven with the might natural to you you have made the earth the counterpart of your might for our help. Encompassing the waters and the sun, you go all the way to heaven. You have become the counterpart of earth and you became the lord of high (heaven) containing lofty heroes. You filled the whole midspace with your greatness. This is certainly true: there is no other like you. Whose expanse neither heaven nor earth reaches across—any more than the rivers reach the end of the dusky realm— nor (do they reach him) who performs his own proper work in his exhilaration while he is fighting. You alone have done everything else in due order. There at this same contest the Maruts chanted and all the gods cheered you on, when with your deadly weapon covered with spikes, o Indra, you struck down against the mouth of Vr̥tra."

The unaging one, drawing his own food toward him, thirstily eager to eat, keeps to the thickets. His back when he is sprinkled shines like a steed; thundering like the spine of heaven, he has roared.

The god discloses valuables in due order. Sped by the wind, he spreads himself out among the thickets at will, with his tongues as sickle, powerfully noisy. When, Agni, thirstily you rush like a bull upon the woods, black is your course, o unaging one with gleaming waves.

Whom the seven tongues, whom the cantors choose as Hotar, best sacrificing at the ceremonies, to Agni, the nave of all goods, I render service with a pleasurable offering. I beg for a treasure. O son of strength with the might of Mitra, today hold out unbroken shelters to us, your praisers. O Agni, child of nourishment, deliver the singer from narrow straits, with your metal strongholds.

Just this one—with his swelling strength Indra hewed apart snorting Vr̥tra with his mace. The streams, pent up like cows, he released toward fame, of one mind (with them), for giving. Just this one—the rivers with their glittering came to rest when he held them encircled with his mace.

When you have set your mind on journeying on the byways like birds, o Maruts, along who knows what path, the casks on your chariots drip. Sprinkle ghee the color of honey for the one who chants. At their drives, at their journeys the earth trembles like one with faltering step, when they hitch up, for beauty. Playful, boisterous, with glinting spears, the shakers admire their own greatness. For such is the flock: youthful, self-propelling, possessing dappled horses, irrepressible, showing mastery, swathed in powers. And you are a real, irreproachable requiter of debts, a furtherer of this insight here. Therefore you [=Gotama Rāhūgaṇa] are (also) a bullish flock. We speak by virtue of our kinship with our primordial father; the tongue advances with the eye of soma. When, equipped with chant, they [=Maruts] reached Indra by their labor, just after that they acquired names worthy of the sacrifice. For splendor they join themselves with radiant beams, with rays, with those equipped with chant—the well-spangled ones, possessing axes and arrows, fearless. They know their own dear Marut nature."

He, confounding the battle-fury (of the foe), the creator of the battle-elation (of the allies), has won the sun along with our men on this very day, the lord of the settlements invoked by many. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help. Him do his help(er)s [=Maruts] cause to take pleasure in the contest of champions; him do the settled peoples make the protector of their peace. He alone is lord of every undertaking. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help.

He, even in association with a weakling, is the winner of the stakes. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help.

He with his male powers prevails over taunts. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help. Since with his kindred or with his non-kin he will drive together (the warriors? the spoils?) when the prize of battle (is at stake), he is invoked by many in (many) ways for the conquering of the waters, of life and lineage. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help. He is the mace-bearer, the Dasyu-smasher, fearsome, mighty, of a thousand insights and a hundred counsels, skillful— like a beaker [?] in his vastness, belonging to the five peoples. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help. His mace roars alongside, sun-winning, like the reverberating, vehement bellowing of heaven. Him do gains follow, him prizes. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help. Whose inexhaustible measure in its vastness, (like our) hymn, will coil around both worlds on all sides, he will deliver (us) with his strategies while he is rejoicing. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help. The limit of whose vast power no gods in their divinity, nor mortals, nor even the waters have reached— he projects with his energy beyond earth and heaven. – Accompanied by the Maruts, let Indra be here for us with help. A chestnut, dusky mare, marked with “stalks” [?] and a blaze, heaven-bright, a portion of the wealth of R̥jrāśva, drawing a chariot with bulls at the chariot-poles, gladdening, has distinguished herself among the clans of Nahuṣa. This very hymn is for you, Indra the bull. The Vārṣāgiras greet your largesse— R̥jrāśva with his sidekicks, Ambarīṣa, Sahadeva, Bhayamāna, Surādhas. Invoked by many in (many) ways, having smashed the Dasyus and the Śimyus to the earth, he has laid them low with his missile. He has won a dwelling place along with his bright comrades [=Maruts]; he has won the sun; he has won the waters—he with the good mace. Let Indra always speak up for us. Not led astray, may we win the prize. – This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven."

Just as she [=Dawn] is impelled forth for the impulsion of Savitar, so Night has left behind the womb for Dawn. Having a gleaming calf, herself gleaming white, she has come here. The black one [=Night] has left behind her seats for her. Having the same (kin-)bonds, immortal, following one upon the other, the two, Day (and Night), keep exchanging their color. The road is the same for the two sisters—unending. They proceed on it, one after the other, commanded by the gods. They do not oppose each other, nor do they stand still, though well grounded—Night and Dawn, of like mind but different form. Light-filled leader of liberalities, the bright one has appeared. She has opened out the doors for us. Having stirred forth the moving world, she has looked out for riches for us. – Dawn has awakened all the creatures. The bounteous one (has awakened them), for (even) one who lies crossways to move, for (another) one to seek wealth to his use, for (even) those who see (only) a little to gaze out widely. – Dawn has awakened all the creatures. (She has awakened) one for dominion, another for fame, another to seek greatness, another to go to whatever his goal. Living being are not alike in what they have in view. – Dawn has awakened all the creatures. This Daughter of Heaven has appeared opposite, dawning forth, the youthful one with gleaming garment. Holding sway over every earthly good, o well-portioned Dawn, dawn forth here today. She follows the troop of those who go away; she is the first of those who, one by one, come hither— Dawn, as she dawns forth, rousing up (every) living being, but awakening no dead one at all. Dawn, since you have caused the fire to be kindled, since you have shone forth with the eye of the sun, since you have awakened the sons of Manu who are about to sacrifice, so you have made for yourself good profit among the gods. How long (will it be) until she will be together with those who (previously) dawned forth and those who will dawn forth now? Bellowing, she yearns after the early ones; thinking ahead, she goes at pleasure with the others. They have gone, the mortals who saw the earlier dawn dawning forth. (This dawn) has now come to be gazed upon by us. And there are those coming hither who will see (the dawn) in the future. Keeping away hatred, guardian of truth, born in truth, gracious, arousing liberalities, of good omen, bringing to birth (our ritual) pursuit of the gods—here today, Dawn, as the most fairest, dawn forth. Over and over in the past the goddess Dawn dawned forth. And today she has dawned forth here, the bounteous one. And she will dawn forth through later days. Unaging, immortal, she proceeds according to her own customs. She has flashed forth with her ornaments at the doorposts of heaven. The goddess has removed the black raiment. Awakening (the world), with her ruddy horses, Dawn drives hither with a well-yoked chariot. Conveying hither flourishing valuables, she makes herself a bright beacon, showing herself ever more brightly. The last of those who, one by one, have gone, the first of those radiating forth—Dawn has whitened widely. Raise yourselves up! The living life-force has come here to us. Away, forth has gone the darkness; light comes hither. She has left a path for the sun to drive on. We have come to where they lengthen lifetime. With reins of speech the conveyor (of oblations), the hoarse-voiced (singer) [=Agni], himself being praised, arouses the radiant dawns. Today then, o bounteous one, dawn for the one who sings; for us shine down a lifetime full of offspring. The dawns, bringing cows and hale heroes, who dawn forth for the pious mortal when the litany of liberalities is raised like (the litany) of Vāyu—to them, the givers of horses, shall the soma-presser attain. Mother of gods, face of Aditi, beacon of the sacrifice, lofty—shine forth. As creator of lauds, dawn forth for our sacred formulation. Beget (it) here among our people, o you who bring all valuables. The bright profit that the dawns convey to the laboring sacrificer—the auspicious thing— – This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven."

Then, o Nāsatyas, a donkey [=Vimada?] conquered the thousand at stake in the contest of Yama. Tugra left Bhujyu behind in a cloud of water, Aśvins, as one who has died (leaves behind) his wealth. You carried him with your breathing ships [=winged steeds] that bob in the midspace far from water. Through three nights and through three days, o Nāsatyas, you carried Bhujyu with your winged ones that wander far beyond: (you carried him) on the wasteland of the sea, at the far shore of the watery (sea), with your three chariots with their hundred feet and six horses. Then you two acted as heroes upon the unsupporting sea, which has no place to stand and nothing to grasp, when, Aśvins, you carried Bhujyu home after he mounted your ship of a hundred oars. O Aśvins, the white horse that you gave to (Pedu), whose horse was bad, to be everlasting well-being (for him)— that great gift of yours is to be famed. The racehorse of Pedu is ever to be called upon by the stranger. O men, you two dug out plentifulness for Pajra’s son, Kakṣīvant, who was praising you. You poured from the filter, the hoof of the bull-like horse, a hundred pots of liquor. With snow you two kept away fire and scorching heat. You placed the nourishment of solid food for him. You brought Atri up to well-being, who had been brought down into the earth cleft together with his whole band. You pushed the well far away, Nāsatyas; you put it bottom up, with its banks [=rim] aslant. Like waters for drinking they [=inspirations] flowed, for wealth to the thirsting thousand (descendants [?]) of Gotama. And, Nāsatyas, from Cyavāna, who had become old, you removed his covering [=aged skin] like a garment. You extended the lifetime of him who was left behind, wondrous ones, and thereby you made him the husband of young women. O men, that is your protective cover to be praised and brought to realization, o Nāsatyas, when you knowing ones dug (him) [=Vandana] out because he was beautiful, like a treasure that had been hidden away, for the sake of Vandana [/for you to be celebrated]. O men, I disclose that powerful, wondrous might of yours, like thunder the rain, in order to win it, as when Dadhyañc son of Atharvan (disclosed) the honey to you by means of the head of a horse when he proclaimed it. Puraṃdhi has called upon your two hands again and again, o Nāsatyas, you of many delights [/of many arms], for what is great on your journey. You two heard (the call) of Vadhrimatī like a command. You gave (her a son) with golden hands. At the critical moment you two freed the quail-hen from the mouth of the wolf, men, Nāsatyas, and, you two of many delights, you made the lamenting sage poet [=Uśanā Kāvya] to gaze far. Because her foot was cut away like the wing of a bird, in the contest of Khela, at the decisive turn, right away you inserted a metal shank for Viśpalā to run, when the stake had been set. R̥jrāśva, who butchered a hundred sheep for the she-wolf—him did his father blind. You placed two eyes in the unassailable one for him to gaze afar, o Nāsatyas, you wondrous healers. The Daughter of the Sun mounted your chariot, like one winning the finish-line with her steed. All the gods approved in their hearts, and, Nāsatyas, you two keep company with her splendor. When you two drove the course for Divodāsa and for Bharadvāja, Aśvins, urging (your steeds) onward, your accompanying chariot conveyed wealth. A bull and a river dolphin were yoked (to it). Conveying wealth with good rule and a full lifetime with good descendants and good men, Nāsatyas, you two of one mind journeyed here with the prizes of victory to the wife of Jahnu, who was setting your portion three times a day. At night you conveyed Jāhuṣa, besieged from every direction, through the easily traversed airy spaces. With your chariot that cuts asunder, o never-aging Nāsatyas, you journeyed through the mountains. At the dawning of a single (dawn), Aśvins, you gave Vaśa the help (needed) for the battle in order for him to gain thousands (of cattle). Along with Indra you two smashed misfortunes and hostilities away from Pr̥thuśravas, o bulls. From the (dry [?]) well also of Śara, son of R̥catka, you supplied water (flowing) upward from below for him to drink. Also for starving Śayu, o Nāsatyas, with your powers you made his sterile cow swell (with milk). To Viśvaka Kr̥ṣṇiya, who was seeking your help and singing your praise, who was aiming straight, Nāsatyas, you gave by your powers Viṣṇāpū to be seen (once more), like a lost animal. Within the waters through ten nights and nine days, bound and pierced by the malicious one, Rebha, who bobbed and twisted in the water—him you two broughtup, like soma with a ladle. I have proclaimed your wondrous deeds, Aśvins. Having good cows and good men, might I be the lord of this (wealth). And both seeing and reaching a long lifetime, might I go to old age as if (going) home."

By which (chariot) you go to the home of the good ritual performer, by that, o men, travel your course to us. You free Atri, the seer of the five peoples, from narrow straits, from the earth cleft along with his band, o men— confounding the wiles of the merciless Dasyu, driving them out, one after another, o bulls. O Aśvins—you men, you bulls—by your wondrous powers you draw back together the seer Rebha, who bobbed away in the waters, like a horse hidden by those of evil ways. Your ancient deeds do not grow old. Like one who has gone to sleep in the lap of destruction, like the sun dwelling in darkness, o wondrous ones, like a buried gem, lovely to see, (dug out) for beauty, you dug him [=Vandana] out for Vandana [/for our celebration of you], o Aśvins. This (deed) of yours in your earth-encircling course, o men, deserves to be praised by Kakṣīvant, the son of Pajra, o Nāsatyas: from the hoof of your prizewinning horse, you poured a hundred pots of honey for the people. You two, o men, gave Viṣṇāpū to Viśvaka Kr̥ṣṇiya, who was praising you. Even to Ghoṣā, living at home with her father, you gave a husband, though she was growing old, Aśvins. You two gave a bright (body) to Śyāva Kaṇva [/Kaṇva, the Dark One] of the great flood [?], Aśvins. That deed of yours is to be proclaimed, o bulls: that you bestowed fame upon the son of Nr̥ṣad [=Kaṇva]. Assuming many forms, Aśvins, you carried down a swift horse to Pedu, an unstoppable prizewinning horse that gains a thousand (cows), a smasher of serpents, deserving to be famed as the surpassing one. These things deserving to be famed are for you, o you who give good gifts: the formulation, the song, the seat within the two world-halves. When the Pajras call you, Aśvins, travel with refreshment and toward victory’s prize for the knowing one! Being sung by Sūnor Māna [=Agastya], o energetic Aśvins, digging out victory’s prize for the inspired poet, and growing strong alongside Agastya through his poetic formulation, you draw Viśpalā back together, Nāsatyas. Journeying where?—Toward the good praise of (Uśanā) Kāvya? To a bed, o sons of heaven, o bulls?— you dug out the one who was buried like a tub of gold on the tenth day, Aśvins. You, o Aśvins, made the aging Cyavāna a youth again through your powers. Your chariot did the Daughter of the Sun choose, Nāsatyas, together with its splendor. You turned your minds again to Tugra in your ancient ways, o youthful ones. You carried Bhujyu from the flood, from the sea, with your birds, your silvery horses. Carried forth into the sea, the son of Tugra [=Bhujyu] called upon you again and again, having gone (to you) on an unwavering course, Aśvins. You carried him out with your chariot, swift as mind, with its good team, o bulls, to keep him well. The quail-hen called upon you again and again, Aśvins, so that you freed her from the mouth of the wolf. With your victorious (chariot) you journeyed across the back of the rock. You crushed the (son) of Viṣvāc [=the Double-Talker?], born by poison. Him who had readied a hundred sheep for the she-wolf, who was led forth into darkness by his merciless father— in R̥jrāśva you put eyes; you made light for the blind one to see. O Aśvins, you bulls, that she-wolf summoned good fortune and the winner’s stake for the blind man, saying, “O men! Like the lover of a maiden is R̥jrāśva (to me), since he butchered a hundred and one sheep.” Great is your help, a joy itself, o Aśvins. Even the lame one do you draw back together, o holy ones. And so Plenty called upon just you two, and you two came to her with your help, o bulls. Wondrous Aśvins, you made the drooping, barren cow, no milk-cow, to swell (with milk) for Śayu. By your powers you carried down to Vimada a wife, the maiden of Purumitra. O Aśvins, wondrous ones, scattering barley by a “wolf” [=a drill plow?], milking out refreshment for the race of Manu, blasting sound at the Dasyu with a bagpipe, you made wide light for the Ārya. For Dadhyañc, the son of Atharvan, you substituted the head of a horse, Aśvins. Speaking the truth, he proclaimed to you Tvaṣṭar’s honey, which was hidden from you, o wondrous ones. Always, o poets, I delight in your favor. Help all my insights, Aśvins. Give us lofty wealth bringing descendants and worthy of fame, o Nāsatyas. Giving Hiraṇyahasta [the Gold-Handed One], o Aśvins, you granted him as a son to Vadhrimatī [She Who Has a Steer (for a Husband)], o men. Your raised up Śyāva [the Dark One], who had been split apart in three places, so that he might live, o Aśvins, who bring good gifts. The sons of Āyu have proclaimed these your ancient heroic deeds, o Aśvins, creating for you a poetic formulation, o bulls. Obtaining good heroes, we would announce the ritual distribution."

And the little fly whispered honeyed (speech) to you, (and now) in the exhilaration of soma, (Kakṣīvant), the son of Uśij, cries out (to you): “You two try to win the thought of Dadhyañc, and then the horse’s head replies to you.” In friendship you offer to Pedu a white (horse), bringing many boons, overcoming contenders, the heaven-bound (horse), hard to overcome by arrows in battles, to be celebrated, and conquering the lands, like Indra."

When he has reached the clans of the secure habitation, will the one worthy of the sacrifice stride widely at their ceremony? He propped up heaven, and he sprinkled its foundation [=earth]. The ingenious one (provided) movable wealth of man and cow for the prize. The buffalo gazed after (Dawn,) the self-created maiden making her choice (of husband), (who turned into) the consort of the horse [=Sun], (then into) the mother of the cow. The surpassing king will come through the days to the age-old call of the clans of the Aṅgirases for the ruddy (cows). He will fashion the mace, his team-mate; he will prop up heaven for the sake of the two-footed and four-footed belonging to men. In the exhilaration of this (soma) you gave the noisy vanguard of the ruddy (cows), (previously) covered over, to truth, when the three-humped (herd) was (momentarily) turned back in its forward surge. You uncovered the deceits and unclosed the doors for the (people) descended from Manu. For you is this milk, consisting of good semen, which your two bustling parents brought as a bounty, (for you) to become surpassing— your blazing legacy, which they gained through sacrifice, the milk of the ruddy one who gives sap as milk. And now he [=Soma] has been produced—let him give exhilaration as he advances; he has shone forth like the sun from this dawn, when the drop, (being impelled) by (priests) having sweat as their oblation, (itself) pouring with the offering spoon, has reached its old (ritual) domains. (Even) when a woodpile provided with good kindling should be far away,the sun (still goes) around the cowpens at the ceremony, when you [=Indra] shine forth, through the days that bring results, for the surpassing one [=Kakṣīvant?] whose clan is on the (wedding?) carts, seeking livestock. You brought here the two tawny (horses) attained from great heaven, as you were battling for the wellspring (of soma), which was overwhelming in heavenly brilliance, when for you to grow strong they milked with stones the exhilarating tawny (soma), that was frenzied for cows [=milk], befriended by the wind. Ingenious, you rolled back from the cow the metallic stone of heaven, which had been brought nearby, when, o much-invoked one, vanquishing Śuṣṇa, you kept encircling him with endless deadly weapons. When it is just before the sun enters into (the fold) of darkness, then cast the missile against the bolt, o possessor of the stones. Even the power of Śuṣṇa that surrounded him—that you tore away from heaven, even though it was well-knotted. The two great surfaces that have no wheels, Heaven and Earth, cheered you on at this deed, o Indra: You put Vr̥tra to sleep powerfully with your mace, as he was lying upon the streams, (and you put to sleep) the boar [=Śuṣṇa?]. You, o Indra, the manly one driving to the men for help—mount the (horses) of the Wind, the best conveyors, easy to yoke. What Uśanā Kāvya gave to you to provide exhilaration, that decisive, Vr̥tra-smiting mace had he fashioned. You brought to a halt the tawny mares of the Sun for men. Etaśa bore the wheel; (you were) on your own, Indra. Having cast (it) forth to the far shore of the ninety and nine (rivers), you rolled the non-sacrificers over into the pit. Protect us from this evil rage and from difficulty in a close encounter, o Indra, mace-bearer. Hold out toward us prizes by the cartload, with horses as their foundation—for refreshment, for fame, and for liberality. Let not your favor wither away from us, o you great in prizes: refreshments will completely cover (us). Give us a share in the cows of the stranger, o bounteous one. Might we be your most bounteous feasting companions."

And it is for (Kakṣīvant), son of Uśij [/the fire-priest], to call for me this glorious pair [=Aśvins], the pursuers (of the oblation), the drinkers, for the whitening (of dawn).

Let the one who grants the gift of hearing, who hears well, hear us—the Sindhu River with her waters who provides good lands. This gift of yours is to be praised, Mitra and Varuṇa. Having received hundreds of cows among the Pr̥kṣayāmas: Pajra, Śrutaratha, Priyaratha, they [=priests and poets] immediately came to prosperity, upon penning them in. The largesse of him who offers great bounty is to be praised. Together might we, having good heroes, win (that) of Nahus, who for the Pajras is the man providing prizewinning mares and for me is the patron (of largesse) consisting of horses and chariots. A man who’s a liar, a crooked liar who presses (soma that’s) like water for you two, o Mitra and Varuṇa, he himself installs a wasting disease in his own heart, while the truthful man gains his object through his oblations. He, spurred by wondrous power, is more forceful than proud Nahus, and his fame is sung by men. He whose gifts have been set loose drives as a pumped-up runner, always the champion in all battles. Now then, as you go to the call of Nahus the patron, o gladdening kings of immortality, hear what largesse of Nabhojū and of Nirava there is for the possessor of the chariot to proclaim in its greatness. “Whichever patron (we belong to), we shall establish him as a force,” so did they say on the attainment of ten-part (gushing [=soma?]). The brilliant things in which the assemblage of good ones [=gods] finds enjoyment—let them all [=gods] gain (them) as their victory prize. Let us find elation in the ten-part gush (of soma?), when the twice five [=fingers?] come, bringing foods. The one providing desirable horses, the one providing desirable reins, and these masters (of goods)—are they heading straight toward the men to surpass (them)? The “flood” with golden ears and bejeweled necks—let all the gods make it wide for us. Let the ruddy ones [=Dawns?], coming here in an instant to the songs of the stranger, find pleasure in both of us [=singers and patrons]. The four young’uns [=foals?] of Maśarśāra and the three of King Āyavasa, the victorious (come) to me.

You, Indra, with surpassing wealth for us: greatness will accompany you, who are so powerful, for our help—(accompany you) like an ally for great help. Most powerful rescuer and helper, (you help) every chariot, immortal one. Another one than us—any one—should you harm, o possessor of the stone—(anyone) who (himself) intends harm, o possessor of the stone.

When he zigzags up to it, our thought goes straight to success. Flowing together, the streams of truth have led (him). Abounding in food, he lies in his own (place) as the wondrous form of nourishment; his second (wondrous form lies) here among the mothers, sevenfold kindly. His third (wondrous form, that) of the bull to be milked, have the young women begotten—him of tenfold forethought. When the patrons, showing mastery through their power, bring him forth from the depth, from the form of a buffalo, when Mātariśvan churns him who, as from olden days, is in hiding in the mixing vessel of the honey, When he is led forth from his highest father, he mounts the nourishment-bringing plants in the houses, when the two [=kindling sticks] set his birth in motion. Just after that the youngest one became blazing with heat; Just after that he entered into his mothers, within whom the blazing one (stayed) without suffering harm. He grew widely in all directions, when he mounted the previous ones [=plants] who spurred (him) on from of old. He races down into the newer, later ones. Just after that they choose (him as) their Hotar at the rituals of daybreak. As if gorging themselves on good fortune, they steer straight (to him), since he, much praised, with resolve and with might always pursues the gods and the laud (of) mortals in order to suckle them, When he, worthy of the sacrifice, has spread out, driven by the wind, wriggling through the old (plants?) like a twisting (snake), unconfined in his flight—(the flight) of this burning one of black plumage and blazing birth, whose road spreads through the airy realm. Like a driving-chariot made by dexterous (men), he speeds toward heaven with ruddy limbs. After that these black (plumes) of his, the patrons of the burning one, retreat from his turbulent flaring, as (from that) of a champion, like birds (from that) *of the sun. By means of you, o Agni, have those rich in drops [/gifts] become exultant—Varuṇa whose commandments are upheld, Mitra, and Aryaman— since, following them, you were born extending everywhere by your resolve, encompassing (everything) like a felly its spokes. You, o Agni, impel treasure and the conclave of the gods to the man who labors and presses soma, o youngest one. Might we now acquire [/install] you anew, o young (son) of strength, like good fortune [/Bhaga] at the decisive moment, o you who have great treasure. For us you will engorge good fortune [/Bhaga] like household wealth meant for a good purpose, like enduring skill, ([good fortune/] Bhaga) who will hold fast both races [=gods and men], like reins, (and also) the laud of gods, and (who himself), of good resolve, (is held fast) in truth. And the bright-flashing, delighting Hotar with his lively horses and gleaming chariot will hear us. Without error Agni will lead us with the best leading to desirable safe passage, to a better state. Agni has been praised with our energetic chants [/with his ardent flames], while being installed further forward for sovereign rule. Both those who are our bounteous (patrons) and we (ourselves) would extend outward, as the sun (extends) beyond the mist."

Who will serve you two for this very favor, when, Vasus, by his homage you two will take your place in the track of the cow? Awaken for us plentiful gifts filled with riches, acting as if with a thought to fulfill our wishes. Because your harnessed (chariot)—swelling, rugged—was set apart in the middle of the flood for the son of Tugra [=Bhujyu], I would come to your sheltering help by flying ways, as a hero (flies) his course. The praise song should give wide space to (me), the son of Ucathya. Let these two winged females [=Night and Dawn] not milk me dry. Let the piled-up, ten-stick kindling not burn me, when he [=Agni], whom you bound by the trunk of his body, chews at the earth. “The rivers, best of mothers, will not swallow me!” (he cried,) when the Dāsas sank him, tightly bound. When Traitana hewed away the head, the Dāsa himself ate his own chest and shoulders. Dīrghatamas, the son of Mamatā, though having grown old in the tenth stage (of life), becomes the chariot-driver of the waters that are moving toward their goal and the formulator (of the truth)."

And I turn my mind to the great and self-powerful mind of the undeceivable father and of the mother, with my invocations. The two fathers possessing good semen have made the land wide for offspring and immortal in its expanses. These their sons, good artisans with wondrous powers, begot the two great ones, two mothers, to be first in their thought. You two protect what is real in upholding the standing and the moving; you protect the footprint of your son who is unduplicitous [=Agni?]. Masters of magical power, having good forethought, they measured [=created] the kindred pair who share the same womb, the married couple who share the same dwelling place. They stretch an ever newer thread to heaven and within the sea—the brilliant poets. The desirable largesse of Savitar shall we think upon today at the impulse of the god.

We have not insulted the cup with its great hollow. Brother Agni, we have spoken only of the excellence of the wooden (vessel).” [Agni:] “ ‘Make the one cup to be four’—that the gods said to you. For that I have come to you. Sons of Sudhanvan, if you will do thus, you will become worthy (recipients) of the sacrifice along with the gods.” When you replied to the messenger Agni, “A horse must be made, and a chariot also must be made here. A milk-cow must be made, and the two must be made young. When we have done these things, brother, we will follow you [=gods].” Having done these things, R̥bhus, you asked this: “Just where has he gone who came here to us as a messenger?” When he caught sight of the four cups that were made, just then Tvaṣṭar was anointed among the Wives (of the Gods). When Tvaṣṭar said, “We shall smash those who have insulted the cup that gives drink to the gods”— they [=the R̥bhus] make other names for themselves during the soma-pressing—by their other names the maiden will rescue them. Indra has hitched up his two fallow bays, and the Aśvins their chariot. Br̥haspati drove near (the cow) of all forms. You—R̥bhu, Vibhvan, and Vāja—went to the gods. By your skillful work you came to a share in the sacrifice. From the hide you made the cow to flow (milk) by your insights. You made those young who were the aging pair. O sons of Sudhanvan, you fashioned a horse from a horse, and having hitched up the chariot, you journeyed toward the gods. [The R̥bhus to the gods:] “You said, ‘Drink this water, or drink this, the rinse-water of muñja-reeds. Sons of Sudhanvan, if you do not in any way find satisfaction in this, you shall find exhilaration in the Third Pressing rite.’” One (R̥bhu) said, “Waters are most important,” and the other said, “Fire is most important.” (The third) one proclaimed the weapon-wielding (speech?) from among the many. Speaking truths, you carved the cups. One drives the lame cow down to the water. One carves the flesh, carried here with a basket. Up till sunset one bore away the dung. Have the parents given help to their sons? You made grass for him on the heights and waters in the valleys by your skillful work, o men, when you slept in the house of Agohya: you do not continue that here today, o R̥bhus. When, having shut your eyes, you crept around the living worlds, where were your loving parents? You cursed him who took your arm. Who made a declaration (to you), to him you also made a declaration. After you slept, R̥bhus, you asked this: “Who awakened us here, o Agohya?” The billy-goat [=the Sun?] said the dog [=the Moon?] was the awakener. Here today, after a year, you opened your eyes. The Maruts travel through heaven, Agni along the earth; the Wind here travels through the midspace; Varuṇa travels through the waters and seas—seeking you, o sons of strength."

When they lead the gift [=goat] held fast in front of (the horse, which is) decked out with a fresh garment and with family treasure, facing well forward, constantly bleating, the goat, representing all forms, passes into the fold of Indra and Pūṣan. This billy-goat, belonging to all the gods, is led in front, along with the prizewinning horse, as Pūṣan’s portion. When (they lead the goat) as the pleasing fore-offering along with the steed, it is Tvaṣṭar himself who stimulates him for (the deed) that brings good fame. When the sons of Manu lead around the horse to be offered three times along (the path) that goes to the gods in proper order, then the goat, Pūṣan’s portion, goes first, announcing the sacrifice to the gods. The Hotar, the Adhvaryu, the Expiator [?], the Fire-kindler, the Handler of the Pressing-stones, and the well-inspired Reciter— with this sacrifice, well prepared and well offered, fill your bellies. The hewers of the sacrificial post and its conveyors, those who fashion the knob for the post for the horse, and those who assemble the equipment for cooking the steed—let the applause also of those urge us on. (When) he went forth, at that same time my thought was produced— (when) the straight-backed (horse went forth) to the regions of the gods. The inspired seers cheer him on. We have made him well connected to the prospering of the gods. The lead-rope of the prizewinner, the harness of the steed, the halter on his head and his bridle, and the grass brought up into his mouth—let all this of yours be also among the gods. What of the horse’s flesh a fly has eaten, or what is smeared on the sacrificial post or on the axe, what is on the hands of the Queller-priest and what on his nails—let all this of yours be also among the gods. The contents of his belly that bloats up, the odor of his raw flesh— let the Queller-priests make that well-done and let them cook the ritual offering until it’s cooked to readiness. What runs down from your leg as it’s being cooked by the fire when you have been impaled on the spit— let that not stick to the ground nor to the grasses; let it be given to the gods, who are eager for it. Those who inspect the prizewinner when cooked and who say about him: “It smells good! Take it off (the fire)!” and those who draw near in hopes of a share of the meat of the steed— let the applause also of those urge us on. The probe for the meat-cooking cauldron, the cups for the pouring of broth, the covers of the bowls that keep them warm, the hooks, and the baskets are in attendance around the horse. (The gear) that made him set his stride, come to a halt, and turn aside, and the foot-fetter of the steed, and what he drank and what fodder he ate—let all this of yours be also among the gods. Let the fire that smells of smoke not besmirch you; let the blazing hot cauldron not topple over. The one sacrificed, sought out, and greeted when the cry “vaṣaṭ” is made: that horse do the gods receive. The mantel they spread out for the horse, the over-mantel, and the gold (trappings) that are for him, the harness, and the foot-fetter—(all these), his own dear things, hold the steed fast among the gods. If, in riding you, anyone goaded (you) with his heel or with a whip, along with too much “come on, come on,” I make all these sweet for you with a sacred formulation, as (priests) sweeten them [=oblations?] by the ladling of the oblation at the rites. The axe converges on the thirty-four ribs of the prizewinning horse, who has connection with the gods. Arrange his legs, undamaged, into patterns, and carve them up joint by joint, having called them out in order. There is one carver of Tvaṣṭar’s horse and two to hold him fast: such is the proper way. The (sacrificial portions) I make from your legs according to the proper order, just those lumps, one after the other, do I offer in the fire. Let your own dear lifebreath not burn you as you go along; let the axe not bring the parts of your body to a standstill. Let a greedy man who is no carver, skipping steps, not make your legs damaged with a knife gone awry. Truly in this way you do not die nor are you harmed: you go to the gods by paths easy to travel. The two fallow bays (of Indra) and the two dappled mares (of the Maruts) have become your yokemates. The prizewinning (horse) has taken his place at the chariot-pole of the (Aśvins’) donkey. (Let) the prizewinner (win) for us a mass of good cattle and good horses, male children, and all-prospering wealth. Let Aditi make guiltlessness for us. Let the horse, accompanied by our oblations, win sovereignty for us."

You are Trita by reason of your hidden commandment. You were separated all at once from Soma [=the moon?]. They say that you have three (kinship) bonds in heaven. Three bonds they say you have in heaven, three in the waters, and three within the sea. And you will appear to me like Varuṇa, o steed, (in the place [=sea]) where they say is your highest means of begetting. Here are (the waters?) to rub you down, o prizewinner, and here places for the winner to set his hooves. Here I saw your good halters, over which the herdsmen of the truth keep guard. With my mind I recognized your lifebreath from afar, a bird flying below heaven. I saw your winged head panting along the dustless paths easy to travel. Here I saw your highest form, seeking to win refreshments in the track of the cow. When the mortal attained the benefit from you, just after that the foremost devourer of plants [=Agni] awakened (you?). The chariot (goes) after you, after you the dashing youth, o steed; after you the cows, after you the good fortune of maidens. The troops have gone after your companionship. The gods have measured themselves against your heroic strength. Having golden horns [=rays], his feet copper, swift as thought he was (an) Indra in the lower (realm). The gods themselves came to eat the oblation of him, who first mounted the steed. The heavenly chargers take their places like geese in formation—with the edges (of the formation) their legs, its middle hollow, its nose a hero [=the lead horse], when the horses have driven their heavenly drive. Your body is flying, o steed; your perception is swooping like the wind. Your horns [=rays], dispersed in many places, keep flickering in the wilderness. The prizewinning steed has gone forth to slaughter, reflecting with a mind turned to the gods. The goat, his umbilical kin, is led in front. The poets and singers come along behind. The steed has gone forth to the highest seat, to his father and mother [=Heaven and Earth]. He should go to the gods today, for he is most pleasing (to them); then he expresses his hope for desirable things for the pious man."

      "text": "This treasured one, the gray Hotar—his middle brother is the ravenous one; his third brother is the one with ghee-smeared back. In him I saw the clanlord with his seven sons. The seven harness the chariot with a single wheel [=the Sun]. A single horse with seven names draws it. Triple-naved [=with three seasons?] is the unaging, unassailable wheel, on which all these living beings rest. As its seven horses, the seven [=the priests] who stand upon this chariot [=the sacrifice] draw the seven-wheeled (chariot). Seven sisters [=voices of the priests] together cry out (the words) in which the seven names of the cows [=poetic speech] are imprinted. Who has seen the first one [=the Sun/Agni] as he is being born, when his boneless (mother) [=the Waters?] carries the one having bones [=the one who is a living being]? Where is the life, blood, and breath of the earth? Who will approach the knowing one to ask this? Naïve, not understanding, in my mind I ask about these imprinted tracks of the gods. Upon the full-grown calf [=the fire] the poets have stretched the seven warp-threads (of the sacrifice) in order to weave. Unperceptive, I ask also the perceptive poets about this in order to know, since I am unknowing: What also is the One in the form of the Unborn [=the Sun] that has propped apart these six realms (of heaven and earth)? Let him speak here, who knows the imprinted track of this treasured bird [=the Sun]. The cows [=rain clouds] yield milk [=rain] from his head [=the Sun]. Clothing themselves in a cloak, they have drunk water with the foot [=the Sun’s rays]. The mother [=Dawn] gave her father [=the Sun/Heaven] a share in the truth, for in the beginning, through her insight, she united (with him) by her mind. Recoiling, she whose essence was her child [=Agni/the Sun] was pierced (by her father). Just those offering their reverence went to the (morning) invocation. The mother was harnessed to the yoke-pole of the sacrificial reward; her child stood up amid the penned cows. The calf [=Agni] bellowed and looked toward the cow of every color [=Dawn], three wagon-treks (in the distance). Carrying three mothers [=earths] and three fathers [=heavens] alone, he [=the Sun] stands upright: they do not cause him to weary. On the back of yonder heaven they [=the gods] recite the speech that knows everything but does not inspire everyone. Twelve-spoked, the wheel of truth [=the Sun] ever rolls around heaven—yet not to old age. Upon it, o Agni, stand seven hundred twenty sons in pairs [=the nights and days of the year]. They speak of the father [=the Moon] with five feet [=the seasons] and twelve forms [=the months], the overflowing one in the upper half of heaven. But these others speak of the far-gazing one [=the Sun] in the nearer (half) fixed on (the chariot) with seven wheels [=the Sun, Moon, and visible planets] and six spokes [=the seasons, in a different reckoning]. In the five-spoked wheel [=the year] that rolls round—on that do all living beings take their stand. Its axle does not become hot, though its load is heavy. From of old it, along with its nave, does not break apart. Along with its felly, the unaging wheel [=the night Sun] has turned away. Harnessed to the outstretched (yoke-pole) [=the airy realm?], ten (horses) draw it. Covered over, the eye of the Sun moves through the airy realm. All living beings are fixed upon it. They speak of the seventh of those who are born at the same time as the one born alone, saying, “the twins, the Seers born of the gods, are only six.” What (places) are desired by these [=the Seven Seers] are distributed according to their spheres. While (the one) [=the pole star] stands still, the ones varied in appearance [=the stars of the Seven Seers] quiver. Though they [=the Kr̥ttikās, the Pleiades] are women, yet they speak of them as men to me. He who has eyes sees; the blind man does not differentiate. One who is a poet, a (poet’s) son, perceives them. One who recognizes these (women), he will be the father of his father. Below the upper (realm), above the lower here [=at the horizon], the cow [=Dawn] carrying her calf [=the Sun] has stood up by her foot. In which direction is she? Toward which side did she go away? Where does she give birth, for it is not within the fold? Below the upper (realm), above the lower here is he [=the Sun] who knows his father. Showing himself to be a poet, who will proclaim this here: from whence has divine thought been born? What (chariots [=sacrifices?] come) this way—they say that those (will go) away; what (chariots go) away—they say that those (will come) this way. O Soma and Indra, (the deeds) that you two have done, these draw (those chariots) like (horses) harnessed to the yoke-pole of the airy realm. Two well-feathered (birds), yokemates and companions, embrace the same tree. Of those two the one eats the sweet fig; the other, not eating, keeps watch. Where the well-feathered (birds), never blinking, cry out for a share of immortality and for the ritual distributions, here the forceful herdsman of the whole living world, the insightful one, has entered me, the naïve one. Just that tree on which all the honey-eating, well-feathered ones settle and give birth, they say, has the sweet fig at its top. He who does not know the father will not reach up to that. How the gāyatrī (track) [=gāyatrī line] is based upon a gāyatrī (hymn) or how a triṣṭubh (track) [=triṣṭubh line] was fashioned out of a triṣṭubh (hymn), or how the jagat track [=jagatī line] is based on the jagat [=jagatī] (hymn)—only those who know this have reached immortality. By the gāyatrī (track) [=line] one measures the chant; by the chant the melody; by the triṣṭubh (track) [=line] (one measures) the recitation; by the two-footed and the four-footed recitation the (full) recitation. By the syllable the seven voices assume their measure. By the jagat [=jagatī] (stanza) he buttressed the river in heaven; in the rathantara (chant), he watched over the Sun. They say that there are three kindling sticks [=three lines in a gāyatrī stanza] belonging to the gāyatrī (stanza). By its greatness it [=the gāyatrī stanza] has passed beyond those in greatness. I summon this milk-cow giving good milk, and the deft-handed milker will milk her. Savitar will impel the most excellent impetus in us. The gharma pot has been heated: this shall I proclaim. Making the sound hiṅ, the goods-mistress of goods, seeking her calf, has come near through (my) thinking. Let this inviolable cow give milk to the Aśvins. Let her increase for our great good fortune. The cow bellowed after her blinking calf. She made the sound hiṅ against his head (for him) to bellow. Lowing toward his hot jaw, she bellows her bellow and swells her swell of milk. This hums—that by which the cow is enclosed. She bellows her bellow, resting upon the smoky (fire). Because she has put down (what is) mortal with the sound “chit-chit,” becoming lightning, she pushed away her covering. Breathing, life rests (though remaining) on its headlong course, stirring (though) steadfast in the midst of the dwelling places. The living one keeps moving by the will of the dead one; the immortal one shares the same womb with the mortal one. I saw the herdsman who never settles down, roaming here and afar along his paths. Clothing himself in those that converge and diverge, he moves back and forth among living beings. He who created him does not know him. He is far away from him who has seen him. He is surrounded within the womb of his mother. Having many offspring, he has entered into destruction. [The Sun:] “My father, my progenitor, is Heaven; here is my navel. My mother, this great Earth, is my relation. My womb is within the two open cups [=Heaven and Earth]. Here my father placed the child [=the Sun] of his daughter [=Dawn].” I ask you about the farthest end of the earth. I ask where is the navel of the living world. I ask you about the seed of the bull(-like) horse. I ask about the highest heaven of speech. This altar here is the farthest end of the earth. This sacrifice here is the navel of the living world. This soma here is the seed of the bull(-like) horse. This formulator here is the highest heaven of speech. The seven children of the (two world-)halves [=the Seven Seers], the seed of the living world, take their place by the direction of Viṣṇu in the spreading expanse. By their insights and their thought these encompassing perceivers of inspired words encompass (everything) everywhere. I do not understand what sort of thing I am here: though bound, I roam about in secret by my thinking. When the first-born of truth [=Agni] has come to me, only then do I attain a share of this speech here. He goes inward and outward, controlled by his own will—he, the immortal one of the same womb as the mortal one. Those two are ever going apart in different directions. They observe the one; they do not observe the other. The syllable of the verse, upon which all the gods have settled, is in the highest heaven— he who does not know that (syllable), what will he accomplish by his verse? Only those who know it sit together here. Because you would become blessed, feeding upon good pasturage, so then we would also be blessed. Feed on grass always, o inviolable cow [=Speech]! Coming here, drink pure water! The buffalo-cow [=Speech] has bellowed, fashioning oceans. One-footed and two-footed, she is four-footed, having become eight-footed and nine-footed: she has a thousand syllables in the highest heaven. Seas flow everywhere from her: by that the four directions live, from that the syllable flows, upon that does everything live. At the midpoint, beyond this nearer (fire), I saw dung-smoke from afar. Heroes cooked the dappled bullock. These were the first foundations (of the rite). Three long-haired ones gaze out in succession: in a year one [=Agni] of them shears away (the land) for himself; another [=the Sun] gazes upon everything with his powers; the rush of another [=Wind] is visible, but not his form. Speech is measured in four feet [/quarters]. Brahmins of inspired thinking know these. They do not set in motion the three that are imprinted in secret; the sons of Manu speak the fourth (foot/quarter) of speech. They say it is Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni, and also it is the winged, well-feathered (bird) of heaven [=the Sun]. Though it is One, inspired poets speak of it in many ways. They say it is Agni, Yama, and Mātariśvan. Along the dark course, tawny well-feathered (birds) [=flames], clothing themselves in the waters, fly up toward heaven. These have returned here (as rain) from the seat of truth [=heaven]. Only then is the earth moistened with ghee. The chariot-wheel (of the Sun) is one, its wheel-segments are twelve, its wheel-naves are three: who understands this? They [=the days] that wander on and on are fitted together on that, like three hundred pegs, like sixty (more). Your breast, which is ever full, which is joy itself, by which you make all desirable things prosper, which confers treasure and finds wealth, which brings good gifts—o Sarasvatī, you prepare that to suckle us here. With the sacrifice the gods performed the sacrifice: these were the first foundations. These, its greatnesses, followed to heaven’s vault, where the ancient Sādhyas and the gods are. This water remains the same: it goes up and down throughout the days. Thunderstorms vivify the earth, and fires vivify heaven. The heavenly well-feathered, lofty bird, child of the waters, and beautiful (child) of the plants, the one bringing satisfaction by the rains from what is bounded by waters: Sarasvant!—him do I call upon again and again for help."

It is just so: Reflecting me here and receiving fame and refreshments as my irreproachable (warrior band), you, who are to be seen all around with your shimmering colors, have pleased me, and you will please me now, o Maruts. [Narrator:] Now who has given liberally to you here, Maruts? Journey forth to your companions here, o companions! Knowing our thoughts intimately, o you shimmering ones, be aware of these, my truths. [Indra:] Since the praise poet will here offer friendship (to you) as if to his friend, (and since) the wisdom of the son of Māna [=Agastya] has brought us here, turn here to the inspired poet, o Maruts. The singer chants these formulations for you. [Narrator:] This is your praise song, Maruts—this song of the praise poet Māndārya, son of Māna. With his refreshing offering he would beg *reconciliation (with you) for himself. – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters."

As if through kindling on your course, you powerfully noisy Maruts, as if in battle, produce your powers, o able ones. Holding their honey close like their own son, the playful ones play, eager at the rites. The Rudras [=Maruts] approach the reverent man with help; the self-powerful ones do not neglect the maker of oblations. To whom the immortal helpers have given riches and prosperity—to the man who does pious service with the oblation— for him the Maruts, like (steeds) spurred on, sprinkle the many realms with milk—they are joy itself. Of you who with your powers enveloped the realms—your spontaneous dashes swooped forth. All creatures and habitations take fright. Brilliant is your course when your spears have been extended. When the manly ones of turbulent course make the mountains roar, or have stirred the back of heaven, every tree takes fright at your drive; every plant bends forward as if driving a chariot. You, mighty Maruts, you invulnerable band—with kind attention deliver us to your benevolence. Where your missile with its gory teeth scrapes (a path), mightily it liquefies (the trees) as a well-placed (goad) sets the livestock flowing. (The Maruts) whose generosity is (as steady as) a pillar, whose gifts are not withdrawn, the restless ones, well-praised at the rites— they chant forth the chant for the drinking of the exhilarating (soma); they know the foremost manly deeds of the hero [=Indra]. With your strongholds with a hundred coils, o Maruts, guard that man from crookedness and evil whom you (previously) aided, whom you (now) protect from (evil) utterance amid the flourishing of his descendants, you mighty, powerful ones who confer abundance. All good things are set on your chariots, Maruts—like powers competing with each other. On your shoulders, in the vanguard, are spangles; your axle turns the wheels separately but at the same time. Many good things are on your manly arms, on your breasts brilliants, dazzling ornaments, on your shoulders antelope (skins), on your wheel-rims razors. Like birds their wings, your splendors have spread out. Great by their greatness, extending, extensive, visible from afar like the heavenly (realms) with their stars, gladdening, good with their tongues, sounding with their mouths, the Maruts, linked to Indra, encircling him with their rhythm. This is your greatness, o well-born Maruts: your gift is long(-lasting), like the commandment of Aditi. For the person of good action to whom you gave it, not even Indra makes it go awry through dereliction. This is your kinship to the earlier generation, o Maruts, that as immortals you many times favored its laud. By reason of this poetic insight (of Manu’s), having favored his attentive hearing, the superior men [=Maruts] showed themselves to Manu all at once through their wondrous deeds. The abundance stemming from you, o powerful Maruts—through which we shall stay powerfully swollen for a long time, toward which the people in the community will stretch out—to that might I attain, *to my desire, with these sacrifices. Here is a praise for you, o Maruts, here a hymn from Māndārya, the respectful bard. With refreshment he would beg propitiation for himself. – May we know refreshment and a community having lively waters."

You, Agni, as [R̥bhu/] the craftsman at hand, are to be rendered homage; you are master of the cattle-rich prize [/Vāja], of wealth. You radiate widely [/(are) Vibhvan]: burn through to giving! You seek to carve up and to stretch out the sacrifice. You, god Agni, are Aditi for the pious; you, as Hotrā Bhāratī, are strengthened by song. You are Iḍā, bestowing a hundred winters in return for skill; you, o lord of goods, as obstacle-smasher, are Sarasvatī. You, Agni, when well kept, are highest vigor. In your coveted color there are beauties in sight. You are the prize, furthering and lofty; you are wealth, ample, broad on all sides. You, Agni, did the Ādityas make their mouth; you did the pure ones make their tongue, o poet. You do the Gift-Escorts escort in the ceremonies; in you do the gods eat the poured oblation. O Agni, through your mouth do all the undeceptive immortals, the gods, eat the oblation poured into you. With you the mortals sweeten their pressed drink. You, as embryo of the plants, were born blazing. You are both equal and a counter(part) to these by your might, and, o Agni, well-born god, you surpass them, since your strengthening nourishment here extends in its greatness through heaven and earth, through both world-halves. The patrons—those who dispatch to the praisers a gift tipped with cows and ornamented with horses, o Agni— lead both us and them forth to a better state. – May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes."

On being kindled through (all) the dawns and the nights, like the sun he has shone with red radiance. With the libations of Manu he conducts good ceremonies—the king of the clans, the guest dear to Āyu. In this way, o foremost Agni, (hymnic) vision swells for us among the immortals dwelling in lofty heaven through the human (lifespans)— (a vision like) a cow giving milk to the bard in the (ritual) enclosures, (bringing) by herself multiform (prizes) in hundreds at her impulsion. May we, o Agni, by our steed get in sight of (wealth) in good heroes, or by our sacred formulation distinguish ourselves beyond (other) men.

O mighty one, become the one for us to proclaim—(as him) in whom the well-born patrons find nourishment, whom the prize-winners approach to sacrifice, o Agni, as you shine amid (our) own offspring in (your) own house. May we both, the praisers and the patrons, be in your protection, o Agni Jātavedas. Over goods and wealth—much glittering, very abundant, consisting of offspring and good descendants—exert your control for us.

Steadfastly drink our soma to your satisfaction, Indra. (Be) near to us in battles, o surpassing one. You have strengthened heaven through lofty chants. Now just those lofty ones [=priests], who will try to win your favor, o you surpassing one, either by their hymns or in strewing the ritual grass that provides (you) a dwelling place, have come to the prize, helped just by you, Indra.

Travel to the soma-drinking with your two fallow bays. Take to yourself the vast power, o champion, by which you cut down Vr̥tra, the son of Dānu, that son of a spider! You uncovered the light for the Ārya; the Dasyu has been set down to the left, Indra. We would win!—we who by your help are overcoming all rivals, the Dasyus along with the Ārya. That was for us: that you made Viśvarūpa, son of Tvaṣṭar, submit to Trita, one of your circle of companions. Having grown strong on this, Trita’s exhilarating (soma) that was being pressed, he laid low Arbuda. He rolled (Namuci’s head) like the sun its wheel. Together with the Aṅgirases, Indra split the Vala cave. Now should the generous priestly gift yield your boon for the singer as its milk, Indra. Exert yourself for the praise singers.

You are worthy of hymns. All things that obstruct have conceded that manliness is his. They have set themselves as the stakes for the successful gambler. You propped up the six far-flung (spaces), and you were on every side of the five sights [=the visible directions] and beyond. You are worthy of hymns. Your heroism, o hero, is good to proclaim: that by your resolve alone you take possession of goods. The vigor (belonging to you, who are) born steadfast and possessing strength, is preeminent. All the things that you have done—(for these) you, Indra, are worthy of hymns. You halted the course of the Sarapas (River) for Turvīti and Vayya to cross. You led him up who was sunk down and shunned, making famed the blind one and the lame. You are worthy of hymns.

He hid the darkness and made the sun visible. The cistern with its mouth of stone, containing streams of honey, which the lord of the sacred formulation drilled out by his power— from that all those who see the sun have drunk. Copiously and all at once, they poured out the water-filled well. All those beings of long ago, whoever they be, are to come to be (again). Through months and years they [=hinderers] block the doors for all of you. The two [=the sun and moon], not lining up (next to each other), move to one (pattern) or the other, to the patterns (of light and dark) that the lord of the sacred formulation has made. These knowing (poets), who, upon reaching (there), reached the Paṇis’ most distant treasury, hidden away, after observing the (Paṇis’) untruths again, went up to enter there from where they came. The truth-possessing poets, after observing the (Paṇis’) untruths again, from there mounted the great paths. They (mounted) the fire, fanned by arms, within the stone.

To him belong the straight-flying arrows [=the hymns] with which he shoots—(arrows) to be seen, drawing the gaze of men, and whose womb is the ear. Placed to the fore, he who leads together and leads apart, he who is well praised—he is the lord of the sacred formulation in battle. When the penetrating one bears away the prize and the stakes through his thinking, just then does the blazing sun blaze at will. Far-going and fore-going is the first (gift) of him who gives abundantly. The things easily found by Br̥ haspati are to be realized. These are the things won by the intent seer, the prize-winner, through whom both races [=gods and humans], their clans, find satisfaction. Far-going everywhere within the lower settlement [=among humans], you, who are great and joy-bringing, increase in power— the god spreads out widely before the gods; the lord of the sacred formulation encompasses all those things. All that is real belongs just to you two, o generous ones. Even the waters do not confound your commandment. O Indra, o lord of the sacred formulation, do you two come here to our offering, like two prize-winning yokemates to their food. Also the swiftest draft-horses obey him. In the public hall the inspired poet bears away the stakes through his thinking. Hating the hard and collecting the debt according to his will is he, the lord of the sacred formulation, the prizewinner in the contest. The battle-fury of the lord of the sacred formulation, who will do the great deed, became real according to his will: He who drove the cattle up also distributed them to heaven. Like a great stream, (the stream of cattle) ran in separate ways through his power. O lord of the sacred formulation, may we be the charioteers of easily controlled, vigorous wealth throughout all our days. Mix heroes among heroes for us, when, being the master through my formulation, you pursue my call. O lord of the sacred formulation, become the guide of this hymn and give life to our lineage.

He (thus) attends to himself, and his progeny and posterity increase—whomever the lord of the sacred formulation makes his own yokemate. Vehement like a river in its surge, with his might he asserts his will over those who seek to act with balls, like a bull over castrated steers. Like the onslaught of fire he is not to be obstructed—whomever the lord of the sacred formulation makes his own yokemate. The heavenly (waters), never drying up, stream to him. As the first, he goes with his warriors to (the contests for) cows. Having power that cannot be blunted, he strikes with might—whomever the lord of the sacred formulation makes his own yokemate. Just to him do all the rivers roar. They have provided many unbroken shelters. In the favor of the gods, having good fortune, he blazes forth—whomever the lord of the sacred formulation makes his own yokemate."

Let each one hear us: Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga, mighty-born Varuṇa, Dakṣa, and Aṃśa. Today, they of common resolve—Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuṇa—will enjoy this praise song of mine— they, the gleaming Ādityas, pure as a stream (of soma) and free of crookedness, disgrace, or injury. These broad and deep Ādityas, undeceivable but ready to deceive (the deceitful), having many eyes, see within the crooked and the straight. Everything is in front of the kings, even the farthest things. The Ādityas sustain what moves and what stands still—(these) gods, the herdsmen of the whole living world, they of far-reaching care, guarding their lordship, possessing the truth, and collecting debts. Might I know this help of yours, o Ādityas, which even in time of fear is joy, o Aryaman. Under the leadership of you all, o Mitra and Varuṇa, might I avoid difficulties like clefts in the earth. Since easy is your path, o Aryaman, Mitra, and Varuṇa—harmless to men and leading straight— therefore speak in our defense, Ādityas. Offer us protection impossible to smash on any side. Let Aditi, whose sons are kings, and Aryaman help us cross beyond hostilities by easy (paths). We would draw near to the lofty protection of Mitra and Varuṇa, as those with many heroes and free of injury. They uphold the three earths and the three heavens. Three are their commandments within the ritual distribution. By truth is your greatness great, Ādityas. That is dear (to you), o Aryaman, Mitra, and Varuṇa. They uphold the three heavenly realms of light—(themselves) golden, gleaming, and pure as a stream (of soma). (They are) unsleeping, unwinking, undeceivable, and widely proclaimed for the straightforward mortal. You are the king of all, Varuṇa, both gods and mortals, o lord. Give us a hundred autumns to gaze far. We would reach the secure lifetimes of former times. I see far neither to the right nor to the left, neither forward nor behind, Ādityas. Be it in naïveté or in wisdom, you good ones, led by you, might I attain the light free from fear. Who has served the kings leading by truth [=the Ādityas] and whom they—and his own prosperity—make strong, he travels by chariot as the foremost man of wealth, proclaimed at the ritual distributions as the giver of goods. Gleaming and undeceivable, he dwells near waters that provide good pasturage, with his own vigor strengthened and with his good heroes. Neither from near nor from afar do any strike down the man who comes to be under the leadership of the Ādityas. O Aditi, Mitra, and Varuṇa, have mercy if we have committed any offense against you. Might I reach the broad light that is free of fear, Indra. Let the long darkness (of death) not reach us. Both (heaven and earth) jointly make heaven’s rain swell for him: (he is) Subhaga, the “Man of Good Fortune,” by name, the one who thrives. Conquering both dwelling places, he drives amid the battles. Both sides are straightforward for him. O Ādityas, worthy of the sacrifice, your wiles that are ready for the deceitful one, your unbound fetters ready for the cheat— like a horseman, might I travel in my chariot beyond these! Might we never be harmed under your wide protection! Let me not find the lack of a dear benefactor, of a friend with many gifts, o Varuṇa. Let me not stand down from wealth easy to control, o king. – May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes."

Because the god, erect and with broad hands, extends his arms for all to obey, even the waters are submissive to his commandment and even this wind here rests in its circling. Even the one who drives with swift (horses) will now unhitch. He has brought to rest even the wanderer from his travelling. He has held in check the greed even of the snake-stickers [?]. Following the commandment of Savitar, “Release” [=Evening] has come. Once again the weaver has wrapped up what was stretched out; in the middle of his work the mindful (worker) has set down his craft. Having pulled himself together, he [=Savitar] has stood up. He has always kept the seasons separate. As Proper Thinking, god Savitar has come. The domestic blaze of fire is dispersed prominently throughout the houses, one for each, for (each one’s) whole lifetime. The mother has set out the best portion for her son, according to his intention, which has been aroused by Savitar. (Whatever) was dispersed seeking gain has been gathered together. Desire for home has arisen in all who roam. Each and every one has come, abandoning unfinished work, following the commandment of the divine Savitar. The watery (race) has been placed by you among the waters; the wild beasts have been dispersed throughout the wastelands, as their share; the forests are for birds. No one violates these commandments of god Savitar. As far as (Savitar’s) benefit extends, Varuṇa (has come) to his watery womb, restlessly darting about at (every) blink (of the eye). Every mortal creature, (every) domestic beast has come to its pen. Savitar has distributed the races according to their stations. Whose commandment neither Indra nor Varuṇa, neither Mitra nor Aryaman, nor Rudra violates, nor do hostile powers—for well-being I call him here with homage: god Savitar. As (we) arouse Fortune, Insight, and Plenitude—Praise of Men, the husband of the Wives, should help us— might we be dear to god Savitar at the approach of a desirable thing and at the gathering of riches. That desirable benefit given by you has come to us from heaven, from the waters, from earth, (a benefit) that will become weal for your praisers and your friend, the singer whose recitations extend widely, o Savitar."

Let our song become strong.” (So saying) they befriend Agni with kindling wood and with reverence. From heaven they [=the gods?] have directed the ritual distributions of the sages. They have sought the way for (Agni), even for the clever and mighty one. The wise (Agni) of refined skill created joy for himself—he who through his birth is the close kin of heaven and of earth. The gods found the lovely one within the waters; (they found) Agni in the work of the sisters [=rivers or fingers of the priests]. The seven young women strengthened him of good fortune, who is white as he comes to birth, red in his greatness. (Those) mares came to him (newly born) as to a new-born colt. The gods marveled at Agni at his birth. Stretching through the airy realm with his blazing limbs, purifying his resolve through the sage poets as his purifying filters, clothing himself all around in flame, and being the life of the waters, he measures out his splendors, lofty and never wanting. He wandered toward them, who neither speak falsely nor can be deceived, who are the young women of heaven, neither clothing themselves nor naked. Here the young women of long ago, who came from the same womb, conceived their single embryo—they, the seven voices. Strewn about and pressing together are his (flames) of all colors in the womb of ghee and in the stream of the honeyed (soma juices). Here have the swelling cows [=milk offerings] taken their stand. The two mothers of wondrous (Agni) [=the two fire churning sticks?] are the two great ones, the two united. Being carried (as an embryo), o son of strength, you have flashed out, assuming your wondrous forms that blaze and rage. Streams of honey and ghee drip where the bull has grown strong through our poetic craft. At his birth, he found the udder even of his father. He let loose its streams and spurts in every direction. Him who moves in hiding from his kind companions [=the priests]— (though) he was not hidden from the young women of heaven— (Him) who was the embryo of his father and begetter did he himself carry. Alone, he suckled upon the many swelling females. (Protect) his two kindred cowives for the blazing bull, protect the pair [=the fire-churning sticks?] belonging to the sons of Manu for him. The great one has grown strong in the broad and unrestricted (place). The waters (go) to Agni, for glory gets the girls. In the womb of truth lay the lord of the house, Agni, within the work of the kindred sisters. Like a burden-bearing foal [?], at the meeting place of the great (waters?), the one desirable for a son to see and foaming with radiance, the begetter who gave birth to the ruddy (cows of dawn), the embryo of the waters, and the best of men is the young Agni. The (fire-churning) Wood—she who brings good fortune—has given birth to the lovely embryo of the waters and of the plants, to him of various colors. Since they have united in their thinking, even the gods befriend the most admired and powerful one as soon as he is born. Like blazing flashes of lightning, lofty radiant beams accompany Agni, foaming with radiance, as they yield as their milk the immortal (Agni), grown strong within his own seat as if in hiding, within the unbounded container. I call upon you, sacrificing with my offerings, and I call upon your companionship and your favor with desire. With the gods, give help in full measure to the singer, and guard us with your faces that belong to the house. As your dependents, o well-guiding Agni, receiving all riches and thrusting ourselves forward with a fame that comes with good seed, we would prevail over the godless battle-mongers. Here have you come to be the beacon of the gods, o Agni, delighting and knowing all poetic crafts. As the lord of the household, you allowed mortals to settle down, and as a charioteer bringing success, you journey following the gods. The immortal king has taken his seat in the house of mortals, bringing success to the ritual distributions. His face covered in ghee, he flashed out widely—Agni knowing all poetic crafts. Come to us together with your kind companionship, hastening as the great one together with your great help. Make for us abundant wealth that brings us safely across, and a share for us that brings beautiful speech and glory. These your births of long ago, o Agni, and your present ones I shall proclaim for the ancient one. Great soma-pressings for the bull have been made here. Jātavedas has been installed in one birth after another. Having been installed in one birth after another, Jātavedas, the inexhaustible, is kindled by the Viśvāmitras. We would be within the good will of him who is worthy of the sacrifice, even within his favorable benevolence. O you endowed with strength, you of strong resolve, place this sacrifice among the gods for us, giving (it to them). Hold forth the lofty refreshing drinks for us, o Hotar. O Agni, win great wealth by sacrifice. – Make the milk-libation, the very wondrous winning of the cow, succeed, o Agni, for him who invokes you most constantly. There should be for us a son and a lineage that proliferates. Agni, let this your favor be for us."

Once again, as an axe brings together a chariot, the chanters (bring together) with their insight the Hotar [=Agni], (who was) also (the Hotar) of Manu. He made both world-halves shine through his birth. He became the son to be invoked by his two parents [=Heaven and Earth?]. Agni is the conveyor of oblations, unaging and placed for delight, difficult to deceive, the guest of the clans, rich in radiance. In accordance with their will and upon the broad foundation of their skill and power to surpass, the gods gave birth to Agni through their insights. I speak to the great one, shining with his radiance and his light, as one who wants to win the prize (speaks) to his steed. Wanting to win it, we choose the desirable, audacious, verse-worthy prize of the delighting (Agni), the gift of the Bhr̥gus, the fire-priest with a poet’s resolve—Agni (himself), who rules with his heavenly flame. With twisted ritual grass, the peoples have placed Agni in front, him who brings fame as a prize, for the sake of his favor, and with offering ladle extended, they (have placed) him, brightly shining, belonging to all the gods, the Rudra of the sacrifices, bringing success to the offerings of the (ritual) workers. O you of pure flame, because our men with twisted ritual grass in the sacrifices are all around your dwelling, o Hotar, they are drawing near, seeking your company, your friendship, o Agni. Establish wealth for them. The great sun filled both world-halves, when the (ritual) workers supported him when he was just born. And he, the sage poet, is led around for the rite, like a steed, for the winning of the prize, being placed for delight. Revere him who gives the oblation, who makes the rites good. Befriend the domestic Jātavedas. The charioteer of the lofty truth who has no boundary, Agni has become the one placed in front of the gods. The deathless fire-priests purified three kindling sticks for the youthful, earth-encircling Agni. While they placed one of these as a benefit for the mortal, two also went up to the wide world (of heaven) kindred (to the earth). The refreshments of the sons of Manu [=the oblations of ghee] have perfected him, the poet of the clans, the clanlord, to be sharp like an axe. He journeys to the heights and the depths, being ever active. He supports his embryo among these living beings. Since he understands how, the bull enlivens himself in his shimmering bellies like a loudly roaring lion— deathless Vaiśvānara of broad visage, who distributes goods and treasures to the pious man. As of old, Vaiśvānara mounted the vault of the sky, the back of heaven, becoming joyful through our good thoughts. As before, producing the winnings for the (human) race, being awake, he goes around the same course. The inspired one, possessing the truth, worthy of the sacrifice, and worthy of hymns, the dwelling in heaven whom Mātariśvan placed here— him do we beseech, him whose path is shimmering, whose hair is tawny, beautifully shining Agni, for a newer easy passage. Like the blazing (sun) in its course, the vigorous one of sunlike appearance, the beacon of heaven, standing within the realm of light and awakening at dawn— Agni, the unstoppable head of heaven, him do we beseech with our reverence on high as our prizewinner horse. The delighting Hotar, the blazing one free of duplicity, the lord of the household, worthy of hymns and belonging to all lands, like the shimmering chariot [=the sun?], lovely to see for his beautiful form, the one placed by Manu, do we ever beseech for wealth."

Delighting in the many manifestations of truth, the messenger has flared forth at the shining out of dawn. Agni has been installed among the clans of the sons of Manu—the embryo of the waters and Mitra bringing success through the truth. Beloved and worthy of the sacrifice, he has mounted the back (of the altar), and has become the inspired (priest) to be invoked by our thoughts. Agni becomes Mitra when he is kindled. As the Hotar, he is Mitra; as Jātavedas, Varuṇa. As the vigorous Adhvaryu and the lord of the household, he is Mitra, the Mitra of the rivers and mountains. He protects the summit’s [?] tip dear to him and the track of the bird. The young one protects the course of the sun. Agni protects the seven-headed (chant?) in the navel (of the sacrifice). Towering, he protects the exhilarating (soma?) of the gods. The R̥bhu [=Agni] created for himself the beloved name (of R̥bhu) to be invoked, since he is the god who knows all the ritual patterns. The hide of the grain and the track of the bird, (each) covered in ghee— just that does Agni guard, never lapsing. Being eager, Agni has mounted the eager womb covered in ghee and providing wide entry. Shining, blazing, towering, pure—again and again he has made his mother and father new. As soon as he is born, he grows strong through the plants, when the fruitful (plants) make him strong with ghee.

Let the fires from their overflowing source, along with the falling torrents— (all of them) great refreshments free of deception and free of disease— take pleasure in the sacrifice. – Make the milk-libation, the very wondrous winning of the cow, succeed, o Agni, for him who invokes you most constantly. There should be for us a son and a lineage that proliferates. Agni, let this your favor be for us."

Agni, place lofty vigor in the sacrificer. Companions, create the smoky bull and without faltering go toward victory’s prize. Here is Agni, overwhelming in battles and rich in good heroes, by whom the gods overwhelmed the Dasyus. Here is your womb at its season, from which you shone at birth. Recognizing it, Agni, take your seat here, and then make our songs strong. He is called Tanūnapāt as the embryo belonging to the lord [=the upper churning stick?]. He becomes Narāśaṃsa when he is born, and Mātariśvan when he has assumed his measure in his mother. He became the rush of the wind in leaping forth. The poet is churned out by skillful churning and installed with skillful installation. O Agni, perform good rites. Sacrifice to the gods for him seeking the gods. Mortals have begotten the immortal one, who is no miscarriage, overwhelming, hard-jawed. Joined together, ten unwed sisters [=fingers] embrace the male just born. From of old, bringing the seven Hotars, he has shone forth in the lap of his mother when he blazed upon her udder. Day after day, greatly delighting, he does not blink after he has been born from the belly of the lord. Fighting their enemies like the advance troops of Maruts, those first-born of the formulation [=the Kuśikas] know everything. The Kuśikas raised a formulation filled with brilliance. One by one, each in his house, they kindled Agni.

Great was the womb, great the birth of these here, great the growth of the one with fallow bays [=Indra] through the sacrifices. The victorious (clans [=Aṅgirases?]) escorted the contender [=Indra?]. They distinguished the great light from the darkness. Recognizing him, the dawns rose up in response. He became the lone lord [/husband] of the cows—Indra. The insightful ones bored through to the (cows), though they were in a stronghold. The seven inspired poets impelled (the cows?) with advancing mind. They found the whole path of truth. Himself knowing the way, he [=Indra] entered among them [=cows] with homage. When Saramā found the break in the rock, she made the great ancient herd directed toward one goal. Sure-footed, she led the vanguard of the cows [/syllables]. First recognizing (them), she went to their bellowing.

Following the track of heaven, seeking cows, chanting, the comrade released us, his comrades, from calumny. With cow-seeking mind, they sat down (to a ritual “Session”) with their chants, making for themselves a way toward immortality. Just this was their long Session, by which, for months, they sought to win (the cows) through truth. Surveying (the cows) en masse, they delighted in their own possession, milking out the milk of the age-old semen. Their cry heated the two worlds through. Amid (all) that was born they set the outstanding one [=Indra?]; amid the cows they set heroes. He was Vr̥tra-smasher with (the help of) those who were born (together) [=Maruts], and he sent the ruddy (cows) surging upward with oblations and with the chants (of the Aṅgirases)—he is Indra. She of broad extent, bearing ghee-rich (milk) to him, milked out honey, sweetness—the thoroughbred cow. It was for the father that they performed a ritual Session, for him also they prepared a seat, because the good workers surveyed the great, turbulent (cowpen). Propping apart with a prop the two begetters [=Heaven and Earth], while sitting (the Session) they fixed upright the dazzling (seat). When the great (Earth), the Holy Place, has set him to piercing— him who is grown strong in a single day, spread wide in the two world-halves, and in whom the flawless hymns are united—(then) all powers are conceded to Indra. Great is your comradeship—I long for it here, and for your powers. Numerous teams [=our poetic thoughts] come here to the Vr̥tra-smasher. Great is the praise song.

Great the dwelling place, abundant the gleaming (goods) that he found; thereupon he assembled movable (goods [=livestock]) for his comrades.

Along with the hastening ones, you set to running the flooding waters, When you sent forth the waters, like steeds to run in a contest—having smashed Vr̥tra, who was lying still, with your moving weapon of death, o Indra, him having surrounded the goddesses, godless himself. Let us sacrifice to Indra, increased through homage, lofty and towering, unaging and youthful, whose greatness the two dear world-halves measured, but did not measure up to the greatness of him worthy of the sacrifice. Many are the well-done deeds of Indra. The All Gods do not violate the commandments (of him), who upholds earth and this heaven. Of wondrous power, he begot the sun and the dawn. Undeceptive one, this greatness of yours is truly real: because, just born, you drank the soma, not the heavens, Indra, nor the days, nor the months and years could obstruct the strength of you, the powerful one. You, Indra, just born, drank the soma for exhilaration in the highest distant heaven. After you had entered heaven and earth, then you became the first to suckle the bard. You smashed the serpent lying around the flood, displaying its strength—you powerfully born, as more powerful (than he). Heaven did not come close to your greatness then, when you wore the earth on the other hip. Since the sacrifice has become your strengthener, Indra, and the dear ritual meal of pressed soma also, aid sacrifice upon sacrifice, being the one who deserves the sacrifice; the sacrifice aided your mace in the serpent-smashing. With the sacrifice as aid I (previously) brought Indra nearby with his aid. May I turn him hither for newer favor, him who was strengthened by previous praises, who by midmost ones and by the present ones. She labored when she begot me [=poet]—the Holy Place [=Earth? ritual ground?]. I shall praise Indra before the decisive day, so that at that time he (will) carry us across (to the far shore) of constraint, as if with a boat. Both (sides) call upon him as he travels. His (soma) tub is filled—hail! As a man pours out a bucket, I have poured (for him) to drink. And the dear soma drinks have together turned him here with respectful circumambulation, to exhilarate Indra. Not the deep river nor the surrounding peaks could obstruct you, much-invoked one, when impelled just so from your comrades,Indra, you broke into the cattle enclosure though it was firmly fastened. – For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this raid, at the winning of the prize of victory, the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes."

I wish for the favor of you who deserve the sacrifice. [Viśvāmitra:] The cattle-seeking Bharatas have entirely crossed; the poet has shared in the favor of the rivers.

Become strengthened by our hymns, becoming exhilarated on the refreshing drink. Stay just so, bounteous one; don’t go away. I will sacrifice to you from the well-pressed soma. I grasp your hem like a son his father’s—Indra, powerful one—with the sweetest hymn. Let us both recite, Adhvaryu: sing in response to me. Let us both make a vehicle enjoyable to Indra. Sit right here on the ritual grass of the sacrificer. And then the hymn will be recited to Indra. Just the wife is the home; she is the womb. Let your yoked fallow bays convey you to it. Whenever we will press soma, Agni the messenger will run to you. Drive yon, bounteous one, and drive hither. Brother Indra, in both places there is a goal for you, where there is a resting place for your lofty chariot and unhitching for your prizewinning donkey. You have drunk the soma; drive forth home, Indra: your lovely wife, a great delight, is in your house, where there is a resting place for your lofty chariot and unhitching accompanied by (priestly) gifts for your prizewinner. These benefactors, the Aṅgirases in different form, sons of heaven, heroes of the Lord, giving bounties to Viśvāmitra at the Pressing of a Thousand, lengthen their own lifetime. Form after form the bounteous one assumes, wrapping his own body in tricks, when three times a day he has come here from heaven in an instant, drinking out of turn by (the power of) his own (magic) spells, (though) he possesses the truth. The great seer—god-begotten, god-sped, (though) possessing a man’s sight—stayed the river in flood. When Viśvāmitra conveyed Sudās (across the rivers), Indra made friends with the Kuśikas. Like geese, you make a signaling call with the pressing stones, becoming exhilarated on hymns at the ceremony when (the soma) is pressed. You inspired seers who have the sight of men, along with the gods drink the somian honey, you Kuśikas. Come forth, Kuśikas; make yourselves known. Release the horse of Sudās, to (gain) wealth. The king will smash the obstacle to the east, to the west, to the north. Then he will sacrifice on the best part of the earth. I who have praised both these two world-halves here and Indra— Viśvāmitra’s sacred formulation here guards the Bharata people. The Viśvāmitras have given the formulation to Indra who bears the mace. He will make us well rewarded. What do the cows do for you among the Kīkaṭas? They do not milk out the milk mixture; they do not heat the gharma[=hot]-drink. Bring here to us the possessions of Pramaganda. Make the descendant of Nīcāśākha subject to us, bounteous one. The squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī, given by the Jamadagnis, banishing neglect, has bellowed loftily. (She like) the Daughter of the Sun has stretched (their [=the Jamadagnis’]) fame, immortal and unaging, to the gods. The squirming, sappy (cow called) Sasarparī swiftly brought fame to them among the communities of the five peoples, having taken on new life (like Dawn, though) in her winglessness, she whom the Palastis and Jamadagnis gave me. Let the two oxen be steadfast, the axle firm; let the chariot-pole not be torn off, nor the yoke be broken off. Let Indra keep the two pātalyas [=pieces of chariot?] from breaking. You with indestructible wheel-rims, escort us. Put power in our bodies, power in our draft-oxen, Indra— power for our kith and kin to live, for you are the giver of power. Engird yourself in the hardwood of the acacia tree; place strength in the śiṃśapā(-wood) in its recoil. O Axle, you who are firm and were made firm, stay firm. Don’t make us leave off from this journey. Let this Lord of the Forest [=tree] here not leave us behind and not cause us harm. (Let there be) well-being all the way to the houses, to the unharnessing, to the unhitching. Indra, with your manifold means of help, which are the best possible ones, quicken us today, bounteous champion. Whoever hates us, let him fall low. Whomever we hate, let breath leave him. (Though) he heats his axe all the way through, it’s just a śimbala flower he hacks off. The ukhā-pot, (though) boiling, boiling over, just throws off foam, o Indra. There is no notice taken of his missile, you people. They lead a lump, thinking it a beast. (But) they are not making a non-prizewinner race with a prizewinner, nor leading a donkey before the horses. Are these the sons of Bharata, Indra? They take note of the non-meal, not the meal. They spur the alien horse, not their own. At the contest they lead around the one whose prize is (just) a bowstring."

Let your truth be real, you two world-halves. Come to the fore for our great welfare. Here is homage to Heaven and to Earth, o Agni. I render service with a pleasurable offering; I beg for a treasure. For also the ancient ones, speaking what is real, found you two, you truthful world-halves. Also the superior men at the clash, at the contest of champions, extolled you two, o (Heaven and) Earth, as they kept discovering you. Who knows for certain? Who will here proclaim (it)? What is the pathway that leads to the gods? Their lowest seats are visible, (but those) that are amid the highest hidden commandments... ? The sage poet, (though) having a man’s sight, has looked upon them: the two [=Heaven and Earth], separated but becoming exhilarated (together) in the womb of truth.

The One is master of all: the moving and the fixed, the walking and the flying, of various sorts, variously born. From afar I tread upon the ancient (path) of old [/study the ancient One of old]: that is our relationship to the great father [=Heaven?], the begetter,where [=in heaven?] the gods, as admirers, in their own ways took their stand within (it) on their (own) broad separate path. This praise here I proclaim, you two world-halves. The tender-hearted ones having Agni as their tongue will hear it— the youthful sovereign kings, Mitra, Varuṇa, the Ādityas, sage poets, extending far and wide. Savitar of the golden hands and the lovely tongue, being master at the rite three times a day— and (when), Savitar, you have set your signal-call among the gods, then impel wholeness to us. Of good action, of good hands, of good aid, truthful—let God Tvaṣṭar establish these things for us for help. In company with Pūṣan, o R̥bhus, make yourselves exhilarated. With pressing stones raised, you have fashioned the ceremony. The Maruts with lighting as their chariot, brandishing spears, the young bloods of heaven, born of truth, irrepressible, and Sarasvatī—those worthy of the sacrifice will listen. Confer wealth along with heroes, you powerful ones. The recitations, the chants have gone to Viṣṇu of many wonders as if on a journey of victorious Bhaga— (Viṣṇu) the wide-striding humped (bull), who has many (women). The young mothers-to-be are not neglectful. Indra, being master by virtue of all his heroic powers, filled both world-halves with his greatness, stronghold-splitter, Vr̥tra-smasher, possessor of a bold host. Having massed it together, bring to us here an abundance of livestock. The Nāsatyas, asked about our kinship, are my fathers. Our cherished name is our common birth with the Aśvins. Because you are wealth-givers of wealth to us, you keep watch over giving with unstinting (gifts), as undeceivable ones. Great is this cherished name of yours, o poets [=R̥bhus], that you all become “gods” to Indra. You are partner with the dear R̥bhus, much-invoked one. (All of you,) fashion this insight here for us to win. Aryaman, Aditi, (all those) worthy of our sacrifice—the commandments of Varuṇa cannot be cheated— (all of you,) keep us from coming to childlessness. Let our course be full of offspring and livestock. The messenger of the gods, impelled forth in many forms—let him pronounce us blameless in our entirety. Let Earth, Heaven, and the Waters hear us, and the Sun with the heavenly bodies, and the broad midspace. Let the bullish mountains with stable dwelling places hear us, as they become exhilarated on the refreshing drink. Let Aditi with the Ādityas hear us. Let the Maruts extend to us beneficial shelter. Let our path be always easy to travel, abounding in food. Gods, saturate the plants with honey. (Let there be) a share in your fellowship for me, Agni. You should not be neglectful. Might I reach the seat of wealth consisting in much livestock. Sweeten our oblations, illuminate our refreshments entirely. Mete out full measures of fame in our direction.

When Agni has been kindled might we speak only truth: “Great is the one and only lordship of the gods.” The common king has been dispersed in many places; he lies in his resting places [=hearths], (spread out) for some distance along the (fire-)logs. Another bears the calf; the mother rests peacefully [=the two fire-churning sticks]. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. He is dwelling in the older (plants), growing up through the later ones, within the tender ones (even) when they are just born. Having (him) within, (though) unimpregnated they give birth to (him). – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods.

His every approach appears right in your face, like that of a champion battling up close. The thought acts as go-between to the tribute of the cow [=ghee as oblation]. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. The gray messenger [=smoke] keeps bearing down on them [=hearths? plants?]. The great one acts the go-between through the luminous realm. Bearing wondrous forms, he looks out upon us. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. Viṣṇu, the cow-protector, protects the highest pen, establishing his own dear, immortal domains. Agni knows all these worlds. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. The twins [=Night and Dawn] have assumed wondrous forms, each one for herself. One of them shines; the other is black; the dusky one and the ruddy one are sisters. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. Where the mother and the daughter [also =Night and Dawn], the two sap-yielding milk-cows, give suck jointly, I reverently invoke the two within the seat of truth. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. Licking the calf [=Agni] of another [=firestick/Night], she [=oblation/ Dawn] lows: in what form has the milk-cow deposited her udder? Iḍā [/Refreshment] has swelled with the milk of truth. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. At her feet she of many shapes [=Dawn] clothes herself in wondrous forms. She stands erect, constantly licking the (calf) three lambing-seasons old. I roam through the seat of truth as a knowing one. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. Like two footprints set down within the wondrous one [=Agni? ritual ground?], the one of the two is hidden, the other visible [=Night and Dawn]. Their pathway has a single goal, (but goes) separately. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. Let the milk-cows [=Dawns? plants crackling as they burn?] be noisy, those which are without young (yet) sap-yielding, unfailing, not milked out, becoming young ever anew. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. Though the bull goes about roaring within the one (herd of) cows, he deposits his seed in the other herd. For he is the earth-protector; he is the apportioner; he is king. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. The hero’s abundance of horses we will proclaim just now, o people. The gods know of it. Yoked sixfold, five after five they convey (Indra) hither. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. God Tvaṣṭar, the impeller providing all forms, flourishes; he has begotten offspring in great quantity, and all these creatures here are his. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. He [=Indra?] has raised up together the two great bowls (to be) united. Both of them are crammed with his goods. The hero is famed for finding goods. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. And he who suckles all of us [=Agni] dwells peacefully on this earth here, like a king with established alliances, stationed in front like heroes stationed for protection. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods. The plants and the waters offer tribute to you; the earth bears wealth for you, Indra. May we be your comrades, sharing in the valuables. – Great is the one and only lordship of the gods."

As you make your progress to the same goal (as the older dawns), roll yourself hither like a wheel, you newer one.

This (man) here, latest of many, seeking wealth, keeps calling on you two time after time for help. Indra and Varuṇa, in concert with the Maruts, with Heaven and with Earth, listen to my call.

Br̥haspati belonging to the All Gods, enjoy our oblations. Grant treasures to the pious man. To blazing Br̥haspati give reverence with recitations at the ceremonies— his unbowed power I desire— To the bull of the settled domains, having all forms, undeceivable, Br̥haspati worthy to be chosen. Here is a lovely praise hymn, utterly new, for you, Pūṣan, glowing god. It is recited by us to you. Enjoy this hymn of mine—help our insight that seeks the prize— like a bride-seeking (man) a maiden. He who looks at all creatures separately and sees them whole, that one, Pūṣan will become our helper. Might we make our own that desirable effulgence of god Savitar, who will rouse forth our insights. Seeking the prize, we beg for the generosity of Bhaga, along with the plenitude of god Savitar. To god Savitar do the men, the inspired poets, give reverence with sacrifices and well-twisted hymns, when impelled by insight. Soma proceeds, finding the way; he goes to a rendezvous with the gods, to sit in the womb of truth. Soma—for us, for the two-footed, and for the four-footed livestock, he will make refreshments that bring no disease. Increasing our lifetime, overcoming hostilities, Soma has sat on the seat. Mitra and Varuṇa, sprinkle our pastureland with ghee, the realms with honey, you of good resolve. Widely proclaimed, increasing through reverence, you rule by the greatness of your skill through the longest (spaces? times?), you of blazing commandments. Being hymned by Jamadagni, sit in the womb of truth. Drink the soma, you two increasing through truth."

O comrade, turn to your comrade, like a wheel to a swift (horse), like chariotry at speed, for us, o wondrous one, at speed. Agni, you (will) find grace in company with Varuṇa, with the all-radiant Maruts. To press out progeny, o blazing one, make luck; for us, wondrous one, make luck. You, Agni, knowing one—for us may you please placate through prayer the anger of god Varuṇa. As best sacrificer, best conveyor (of oblations), constantly blazing, release all hatreds from us. You, Agni, come down close to us with your help; be nearest to us at the breaking of this dawn. Through sacrifice placate Varuṇa for us, as you give to us. Pursue his grace; be easy for us to invoke. Of this well-portioned god here his manifestation is the fairest, the most brilliant one among mortals. Gleaming like the heated ghee of the inviolable (cow), (the manifestation) of the god is eagerly sought like the largesse of a milk-cow. Three times do these highest births of his come into existence—the eagerly sought births of the god Agni. Enveloped within the limitless, he has come here—a blazing flame, ever shining for the stranger. As messenger he strives toward all seats, the Hotar whose chariot is golden, whose tongue is amid the pleasures [=oblations], whose horses are ruddy, he wondrous, far-radiant, always pleasurable like a banquet abounding in food. He makes men perceive [=instructs them], as their tie to the sacrifice of Manu; they lead him forth with a great halter. He dwells peacefully in his houses, assuring success; the god attains the fellowship of the mortal. Let Agni, knowing (the way), lead us to the treasure, which was apportioned to him by the gods. (The treasure) which all the immortals created with their insight, which Father Heaven as begetter (created)—(that) they sprinkled (so it became) real. He was born first in the dwelling places, at the base of this great realm, as his womb, footless, headless, concealing his two ends, continually retracting (his limbs [=flames]), in the nest of the bull. The troop [=Aṅgirases] set forth first amid admiration to the womb of truth, to the nest of the bull— The eagerly sought youth, wondrous, far-radiant [=Agni]—the seven dear ones [=Aṅgirases or their music] begat (him) for the bull. Our forefathers here, belonging to Manu, stationed themselves in front, panting over the truth. They [=the forefathers/Aṅgirases] drove up those with a rock as their pen, the good milkers within the cave, the ruddy dawns being called to. They [=the forefathers/Aṅgirases] cleaned themselves, after having split the stone. This (deed) of theirs the others proclaimed all about. Lacking ropes to hold the livestock, they sang the decisive act: “They found the light! They sought it with their insightful thoughts!” Those with their mind set on cattle (opened up) the solid, knotted-up, enclosing stone that held the cows. The firmly fixed pen full of cows did the men, the fire-priests, open up with divine speech. They brought to mind the first name of the milk-cow; thrice seven highest (names) of the mother they found. (The cows) recognizing it [=the name], bellowed out (to the men), (like) maidens (announcing their bridegroom choice). The ruddy one [=Dawn] became manifest with the glorious (name) of the cow. The bilious darkness disappeared; heaven lightened; the radiance of the goddess Dawn arose. The Sun mounted the lofty fields, looking upon the straight and the crooked among mortals. And then afterward having awakened they looked about; and then they held up the treasure apportioned by heaven— all the gods (did so) in all the houses. O Mitra, Varuṇa—let it [=treasure] come into existence (also) for our insightful thought. I would call here blazing Agni as Hotar, the best sacrificer who carries all burdens. He drilled, seemingly, the gleaming udder of the cows, which was purified like the stalk of the plant poured in circles [=soma]. As the Aditi of all those worthy of the sacrifice [=gods], the guest of all the sons of Manu [=men], let Agni Jātavedas, choosing the aid of the gods, become very gracious."

O son of strength, o Agni, created here for us today, between both created (peoples [=men and gods]) you shuttle as messenger, o high one, having yoked your (horses) with their testicles stretched out (behind from speed), (the horses) bullish and blazing. The two chestnut steeds of truth, strong(-backed), ghee-backed, I consider to be swiftest (even in comparison) with mind. Yoking these two ruddy ones, you shuttle between (all of) you gods and the clans here, the mortals. Among those (gods), convey Aryaman, Varuṇa, Mitra, Indra and Viṣṇu, the Maruts, and the Aśvins just here, to the person providing good oblations, o Agni—you who have good horses, good chariot, good rewards. O Agni, a sacrifice bringing cows, sheep, horses, and manly comrades is never to be spurned. Bringing refreshment and progeny, o Lord, it is long wealth, broad of base, fit for the assembly. Whoever will bear fuel to you though sweating, or will scorch his head in serving you, for him you will become a self-powerful protector, Agni. Make for him wide protection from everyone who bears malice. Whoever will bring food to you just as you seek food, will whet (you) down, will raise (you) up as the gladdening guest, will, seeking the gods, kindle (you) here in his dwelling—in him let wealth, rich in gifts, be steadfast. Whoever at evening, whoever at dawn will celebrate you, or offering an oblation will make you a dear (friend) in his own house—like a horse with much spurring you will carry that pious man out of narrow straits. Whoever will perform pious service for you, Agni, the immortal one, whoever, with his offering ladle raised, will offer friendly service to you, that one, having labored to exhaustion, will not stay distant from wealth, nor will the narrow straits of the malicious enclose him. Whose ceremony you will enjoy, Agni—a god enjoying the well-positioned ceremony of a mortal, while you give— just his ritual offering will be pleasing, o youngest one—(the man) whose strengtheners we will be when he does (you) honor. Insight and lack of insight will the knowing one [=Agni] distinguish, like backs, straight and crooked, (like) mortals. And for the sake of wealth and good descendants for us, o god, both grant Diti [/Giving] and make wide space for Aditi [/Boundlessness]. The poet [=Agni] have the undeceivable poets instructed, fixing him down fast in the houses of Āyu. From there, Agni, you should look with your eyes upon those who are easily seen and upon the unerring ones (who go) along the ways of the stranger. You, Agni, offering good guidance, to the cantor, to the one with pressed soma who does honor, o youngest one, bring a treasure, broad and gleaming—to the one who labors to exhaustion, to help him, o excitable one, you who fill the settled domains. Then while we [=sacrificing priests] have acted, with feet, with hands, with bodies, in serving you, Agni, like those making a chariot with the work of (our/their) two arms, those of good insight [=poets] have held fast to the truth, panting over it. Then as the seven inspired poets might we be born from mother Dawn, as the foremost ritual adepts for men. Might we become sons of heaven, Aṅgirases. Might we break the rock that holds the prize, as we blaze. Then like our further forefathers of old, panting over the truth, o Agni, those reciting solemn speech (now) will come to the blazing (udder of sacrifice [=Vala]), to visionary power. Splitting (heaven and) earth, they (will) unclose the ruddy (cows [=dawns]). Those of good work and good light, seeking the gods, smelting the races of the gods like metal, they went blazing, strengthening Agni and Indra, besieging the cattle pen. He [=Agni?] watched over them like (a herdsman) the herds of livestock in a cattle-rich (pasture)—watched over the race of gods that was nearby, o strong one. The Urvaśīs yearned also for (the race of) men, also for the increase of the stranger, of Āyu to come. We have acted for you; we have been good workers—(as) the radiant dawns have clothed themselves in truth— we always grooming in many ways unfailing Agni, beautifully gleaming, the dear eye of the god. These solemn speeches have we spoken to you the poet, o Agni, you ritual adept: enjoy them. Blaze up; make us better off. Extend to us great riches, o you of many favors."

Though she is black, she is swollen with the gleaming gush, with milk for nourishing offspring. Because by truth even the bull, the male Agni, was anointed with the milk on the top [=cream, that is, butter], not bucking, he went about conferring vigor: the bull as Pr̥śni milked gleaming (milk/semen) from his udder. By truth they threw open the rock, having split it. The Aṅgirases roared along with the cows. For blessing the men besieged the dawn; the sun became visible when the fire was born. By truth the immortal, unharmable goddesses, the waters with their honeyed floods, o Agni— like a competitor beating a tattoo at the start(ing posts)—should set to running, to stream forever. Don’t ever chase after (us, as) the specter of a nobody, a crooked man— neither of a tricky neighbor, nor of a friend. Do not pursue the debt of a dishonest brother (against us), Agni. May we not pay for the “skill” of a cheating partner. Guard us, Agni, with your guards, ever guarding when you are gratified, you good combatant [/very generous]. Spring toward rigid constraint and break it apart; smash demonic force, even though it has grown great. By reason of these recitations become well disposed, Agni; by reason of our thoughts caress these prizes, o champion. And enjoy the sacred formulations, Aṅgiras. May the chant favored by the gods bring harmony to you. All these devices, the secret words, are for you who know, o ritual adept, Agni— the enigmas, the poetic compositions are for you, the wise poet. I, the inspired one, have pronounced them in composed thoughts and solemn speeches."

Being hymned, he will make his meal here. Unhitch as if at the end of your road, o champion, in order to find exhilaration in this soma-pressing of ours today. Like Uśanā, the ritual adept [=Agni] will recite his solemn speech, his thought, for the lordly one who attends to it— Bringing the rites to realization like the sage poet [=Uśanā Kāvya] a secret, when the bull [=pressing stone] will chant as he drinks out the gush. In just that way he [=Indra?] begot the seven bards of heaven; just with the (coming of) day they created the ritual patterns as they were singing. When the sun, beautiful to see, was found through their chants [/with its rays], they made shine the great light which is at dawn. The best of men in his dominance made (it possible) for men to penetrate the blind, bilious shades of darkness with their gaze. Possessing the silvery drink, Indra increased without limit. He filled both world-halves with his greatness. Even beyond that did it reach—the greatness of him who surmounted all the worlds. The able one, knowing all manly (labors), together with his eager companions, gave leave to the waters. The fire-priests, who split the stone just with their words, opened the pen full of cows. You smashed away Vr̥tra, who had been enclosing the waters. Of one mind with you, Earth helped your mace. You sped the seaward floods forward, becoming their lord by your power, you daring champion. When you tore open the rock for the waters, o much-invoked one, Saramā had appeared to you before: “As our leader, tear out an abundant prize, breaking apart the cowpens, being sung by the Aṅgirases.” In your dominance you came here to the poet in need [=Kutsa?] at the winning of the sun, o bounteous one with your mind on men. With your help you urged him on at the invocation to heavenly brilliance; but the Dasyu, possessing magic arts but no sacred formulation, sank down. Drive here to the home (of Uśanā Kāvya) with your Dasyu-smashing mind. In companionship with you, Kutsa will become eager. Do you two, having the same form, sit down each in his own womb. She is trying to distinguish between you two—she is a woman who distinguishes the truth. Seeking help, you drive with Kutsa on the same chariot—you, the goader of the Wind, the master of the two fallow bays,seeking to hold onto the two silvery (horses of the Wind) like a prize to be secured, so that on that day the poet [=Uśanā Kāvya] will exert himself for decisive (help). For Kutsa you laid low insatiable Śuṣṇa, who brings bad harvest, with his thousands, before the day’s first meal. Immediately crush out the Dasyus with (the weapon) that is Kutsa, and then tear off the wheel of the Sun at the moment of encounter. You subjugated Pipru Mr̥gaya, swollen with power, to R̥jiśvan, the son of Vidathin. You scattered down the dark fifty thousand. You shredded their fortresses, like worn-out age a cloak— Placing your body in nearness to the sun, so that the form of you, the immortal one, could be distinguished, like a wild elephant, clothing yourself in might, and fearsome like a lion when you bear your weapons. To Indra have desires gone seeking goods, taking their pleasure at the soma-pressing as if at a (contest) having the sun as its prize, (desires) seeking fame, laboring with hymns, delightful like a home, like prosperity beautiful to see. Just him, Indra easy to call, would we call upon for you—him who performed the many manly (labors), who quickly brings a prize worth securing even to a singer like me, him whose largesse is eagerly sought. If a sharp missile will fly in an instant amid some one of the peoples, o champion, if there will be a terrible clash, o comrade, then, as ever, become the herdsmen of our body. Will you be the helper of Vāmadeva’s insights? Will you be a partner— no wolf—at the winning of prizes? We have come after you (who are) solicitude for us. Widely proclaimed, may you always be there for the singer. While we dominate the strangers in every contest with these men who seek you, Indra, with the bounteous ones, o bounteous one, just as the heavens dominate with their heavenly brilliance, may we find elation through many nights and autumns. Just in this way we have made a sacred formulation for Indra, the bull-strong bull, as the Bhr̥gus do a chariot, so that he will never keep us far away from his partnership, and he will be our powerful helper, the protector of our bodies. – Now praised, o Indra, now being sung, make refreshment swell for the singer like rivers.

After you smashed Vr̥tra with your strength, you let loose the rivers, which had been swallowed by the serpent. At your birth Heaven trembled and Earth flinched in fear of your turbulence and of the battle fury that is yours. The well-founded mountains throbbed, the wastelands shuddered, and the waters ran. He split the mountain, hurling his mace with his strength, revealing his power, displaying his might. He smashed Vr̥tra with his mace in his exhilaration. With their bull struck down, the waters ran swiftly. Rich in heroes, Heaven is considered to be your begetter. The best craftsman was the creator of Indra, who begot him, booming and bearing the good mace, not to be moved, any more than the Earth from its seat. Who, just alone, sets the lands in motion—the king of the separate peoples, Indra invoked by many. All celebrate him, the real one, and celebrate the generosity of the god to the singer and the patron. Entirely his were the soma-drinks; entirely for the lofty one were the most exhilarating exhilarating-drinks. Entirely the goods-lord of goods you became. You placed all the separate peoples in (the path of) your giving, Indra. And on first being born, you placed all the separate peoples in (the path of) your onslaught, Indra. With your mace you hewed apart the serpent who was lying against the (mountain) slopes, o bounteous one. (I call upon) him who smashes entirely, bold and brawny Indra, the great and limitless bull bearing the good mace, who is the smasher of Vr̥tra and the winner of the prize, the giver of bounties, the bounteous one who brings good presents. This one forces his united opponents into hiding, he who alone is famed as the bounteous one in contests. This one brings the prize that he wins. Might we be dear to him in his partnership. And this one is famed for conquering and smiting, and this one brings the cows forward to become his through battle. When Indra makes his fury real, everything, both what stays firm and what flinches, becomes afraid before him. Indra conquered the cows altogether, altogether (the bounties) in gold and horses—he who through the many (autumns) is a bounteous patron, the best of men with these able men of his, the apportioner of wealth and the one who brings the goods altogether. How much does Indra know of his mother, how much of his father, his begetter, who begot him? He who in an instant raises his tempest, as the wind does when sped by thundering clouds, He deprives the man dwelling peacefully of his peace. The bounteous one raises the dust in confusion, a shatterer like Heaven with its missiles. But the bounteous one places his praiser in goods. This one impelled the wheel of the Sun and stopped Etaśa as he ran. Moving crookedly, he [=Agni?] sprinkles it [=Sun? Sun’s horse or wheel?] at the black base of the hide, on the womb of this realm, Like a Hotar performing his own sacrifice on the dark (hide). Seeking cows, seeking horses, seeking prizes, we, inspired poets, rousing the bull Indra for partnership; seeking wives, we bestir the wife-giver providing imperishable aid, like a bucket in a well. Become our protector, showing yourself as a friend who watches over and dispenses mercy to your comrades in soma, our partner and father, the best father of fathers, the creator conferring vitality on the man longing for wide space. Become the helper and partner of those seeking your partnership. Being sung, Indra, confer vitality on the man who praises, for we have fervently acted for you, exalting you with these labors, Indra. Indra the bounteous, praised when he (smashes) obstacles, alone smashes those many and unopposable (obstacles). The singer is dear to him, under whose protection none, neither gods nor mortals, obstruct (him [=the singer]). In just this way shall bounteous Indra, conferring abundance, make these things come true for us, as the unassailable sustainer of the bordered domains.

Who tried to smash you as you lay, as you wandered? What god was merciful toward you when you destroyed your father, having grasped him by the foot?

Let Indra along with the Maruts drive here from heaven or from the earth, swiftly from the sea or from fertile ground, from the realm of solar glory, or from afar, from the seat of truth, to help us. Who is master of substantial, lofty wealth, him will we praise at the ceremonial distributions—Indra, who is the winner along with Vāyu when (refreshments) consisting of cows are at stake and who boldly leads (us) forth to a better state. Whoever, piling reverence upon reverence, rouses speech, begetting it in order to perform the sacrifice, aiming straight, granting many favors, he should bring Indra here to the (ritual) seats with his hymns—he, the Hotar [=Agni?]. When they [=the gods/Aṅgirases?], seeking a holy place, will hasten to the rock with holy fervor, taking their seats at the secret place of (the company of) the fire-priests [=ritual ground/Vala cave?], the Hotar [=Agni] of (the company) belonging to the household, (though) he is hard to kindle, (comes into being) here—he who is the great draft-horse for us in the (ritual) enclosures. When in its entirety the explosive force of the devouring bull [=Agni] accompanies him [=Agni?], for the praiser to take his reward, when (it accompanies) him secretly to the secret place of (the company of) the fire-priests, when (it accompanies him) in order (for the praiser) to go forth to insight, forth to exhilaration— When he opens out the mountain’s enclosures into wide spaces and quickens the swift currents of the waters with gushes of milk, he finds (the cows?) in the secret place of the buffalo, of the bull, when those of good insight convey him for the prize. Auspicious are your hands and well-fashioned your palms, as ones that hold out largesse to the praiser, o Indra. Why are you sitting it out? And why do you not find exhilaration? And why do you not rouse yourself higher and higher to give? Just in this way, Indra, the real sovereign king of goods, the smiter of Vr̥tra, made wide space for Pūru. O you praised by many, in accordance with your will, show your power over wealth for us. Might I have a share in your divine help. – Now praised, o Indra, now being sung, make refreshment swell for the singer like rivers. A new sacred formulation has been made for you, o you of the fallow bays. Through our insightful thought may we be charioteers who always win."

Br̥haspati, on first being born from the great light, in the farthest distant heaven, he, possessing seven mouths [=Aṅgirases] and seven reins [=seers?], being powerfully born, blew apart the dark shades with his roar.

Br̥haspati drove up the ruddy (cows) who sweeten the oblation, who kept lowing as he was bellowing. Thus to the father to all the gods, to the bull, we would do honor with sacrifices, with homage, with oblations. O Br̥haspati, may we, possessed of good offspring and of heroes, be lords of riches. Only that king surmounts all the (forces) belonging to his opponents through his tempestuousness and heroism who supports Br̥haspati (to be) well-supported, behaves agreeably to him, and extols him as the one receiving the first portion. Only he dwells peacefully, well-situated in his own home; for him refreshment swells at all times; to him the clans bow just of themselves—for which king the Formulator comes first. Unopposable, he wins riches belonging to his opponents and those belonging to his allies. The king who makes wide space for the Formulator seeking aid, him do the gods aid. Br̥haspati and Indra, drink the soma, becoming exhilarated at this sacrifice here, you who have bullish goods. Let the drops that stand by you enter you. In us deposit wealth consisting of hale heroes. Br̥haspati, Indra, strengthen us. Let this benevolence of yours keep company with us. Aid our insightful thoughts; awaken plentiful gifts. Exhaust the hostilities of the stranger, of the rapacious ones."

O daughters of Heaven, radiating widely, bestow on us wealth in offspring, o goddesses. Being awakened from a comfortable place in response to you, may we be lords of an abundance of heroes.

You are their wise seer, Indra. When the Maruts chanted to him after he became exhilarated, to Indra who had drunk of the pressed soma, he took up the mace. When he (had) smashed the serpent, he released the exuberant waters to flow. And—you formulators, you Maruts—Indra should drink of this well-pressed soma of mine, for this is his oblation: he found the cows for Manu; Indra smashed the serpent, having drunk of it. After that he propped the two world-halves wide apart; even while enwrapped, he set the wild beast to fearing. Repeatedly taunting the gulper, Indra smashed the snorting Dānava back and down. Then according to your will, o bounteous one, all the gods conceded the soma-drinking to you, when you put the flying golden mares of the Sun behind, though they were in front, in (the presence of) Etaśa. When the bounteous one hews apart his [=Vr̥tra’s] nine and ninety coils at one blow with his mace, the Maruts chant to Indra at the seat (of conflict). With speech in triṣṭubh meter he thrusts heaven (away from earth). As a comrade for a comrade, Agni straightaway cooked three hundred buffalo in accord with his [=Indra’s] will. Indra drank the pressed soma of Manu, three lakes worth at one blow, for the Vr̥tra-smashing. When you the bounteous devoured the flesh of three hundred buffaloes and drank three somian lakes, all the gods called “Carry (the day)!” to Indra as (a gambler calls) “Game!,” when he smashed the serpent. When, Indra, (you and Kutsa) drove to the home of Uśanā with the mighty, speeding horses, as combatant you drove there on the same chariot with Kutsa, with the gods. You combated Śuṣṇa. You tore off the one wheel of the Sun for Kutsa; the other you made into wide space for driving. You crushed the Dasyus mouthless with your murderous weapon; you wrenched those of slighting speech down into a woeful womb. The praises of Gaurivīti strengthened you. You made Pipru subject to Vaidathina. R̥jiśvan brought you here for companionship, cooking cooked foods (for you). You drank his soma. The Navagvas, the Daśagvas [=Aṅgirases], having pressed soma, chant to Indra with chants. Just that cowpen with its covering [=Vala cave]—just that have the men, having ritually labored, opened up. How shall I, (though) knowing them, now encompass your heroic deeds that you have done, o bounteous one, and the new ones that you will do, strongest one? We will proclaim these (deeds) of yours at the ceremonies. Having done all these many (deeds), Indra, by your nature you cannot be circumscribed in heroism. As for those (deeds) you will do even now in your daring, possessor of the mace—there exists no one to obstruct this power of yours. O Indra, enjoy the sacred formulations being made, the new ones we have made for you, strongest one. Like garments, lovely and well made, like a chariot have I fashioned them—I the clever artisan, seeking goods."

Who has seen Indra of the well-naved chariot speeding with his two fallow bays, the mace-bearer, who, seeking one who has pressed the soma, will come to that home, when he is much invoked, with wealth, with help? I spotted his track in secret; I followed the powerful track of the one who laid it down, seeking him. I asked the others, and they said to me, “We men might attain Indra, since we have wakened (early).” We shall now proclaim at the pressing the deeds that are yours, Indra, which you will enjoy (hearing) from us. He will learn who does not know, and he will hear who does know: “This bounteous one is traveling here fully armed.” You made your mind steadfast when you were just born, Indra; even alone you pursue the many for battle. You made even a stone flash like lightning through your vast power; you found the pen of the ruddy cows. When you were born far away in the farthest (realm), bearing a name famous afar, from then on even the gods feared Indra. He conquered all the waters, those whose husband [=Vr̥tra] was a Dāsa. Just for you do these friendly Maruts chant the chant, press the stalk. The serpent vaunting himself, lying on the waters—Indra will overcome the tricky one with tricks. You hewed apart those negligent by nature, stimulating giving, o bounteous one, taking pleasure along with the cow, at the time when you caused the head of the Dāsa Namuci to roll, seeking an (open) way for Manu— For you have made me your yokemate, Indra—just afterward stealing the head of the Dāsa Namuci, which was rolling, (like?) a whizzing stone, like the two world-halves (that roll) forth like two wheels, for the Maruts. Because the Dāsa made women his weapons, what can they do to me? His armies lack strength. Since he [=Indra] distinguished both his [=the Dāsa’s?] streams, therefore Indra advanced on the Dasyu to fight. Together the cows then lowed on every side, since they were here, there, and everywhere separated from their calves. Along with his powerful (men) Indra drove them together, when the well-pressed soma drinks exhilarated him. When the soma drinks rinsed by Babhru exhilarated him, the bull set up a bellowing among the (ritual) seats. The stronghold-splitting Indra, having drunk of it, gave again of the ruddy cows. The Ruśamas have done this auspicious thing, o Agni, in giving four thousand cows. The proffered bounties of R̥ṇaṃcaya, most manly of men, we have accepted. The Ruśamas send me home well-ornamented with thousands of cows, o Agni. The sharp (soma-drinks, when) pressed, exhilarated Indra at the early brightening of the night, at its final turn. (When) that night brightened at its final turn, at (the hands of) R̥ṇaṃcaya, king of the Ruśamas, like a steed quick in competition, being driven [/anointed], Babhru won four thousand (cows). Four thousand bovine livestock have we accepted from the Ruśamas. Also the gharma pot, which was heated for the Pravargya rite, the one made of copper, that too have we inspired poets taken."

Run hither, you of the fallow bays; do not lose the track. You of tawny [=golden] gifts, accompany us, for there exists nothing better than you, Indra: you have provided even those lacking the brideprice with wives. When he was born as might from might, Indra displayed all his Indrian powers. He impelled forth the good milkers (who were) within the cave; he pried apart the darkness, which was rolled up in a ball, with light. The Anu people fashioned a chariot for your horse; Tvaṣṭar (fashioned) the brilliant mace, o much invoked one. The formulators, magnifying Indra with their chants, strengthened him to smash the serpent. When for you the bull, o Indra, the bulls and the pressing stones will chant a chant, with Aditi in concord— the (pressing stones like) wheel-rims which, (even) without horses, without chariots, but impelled by Indra, rolled over the Dasyus— I will proclaim your previous deeds, proclaim the current ones that you have done, bounteous one, when, potent one, you will pull apart both world-halves, winning the waters, bright in drops, for Manu. Just this now is your deed, wondrous poet: that smashing the serpent, you measured out your strength there. Even Śuṣṇa’s magic arts you enveloped; on your way to the ritual meal you repelled the Dasyus. You brought the waters, the good milkers, to rest for Yadu and Turvaśa, (when you were their) transport, Indra. You two drove to the strong one [=Uśanā]—that is, you conveyed Kutsa—when the gods encountered you two along with Uśanā. [Uśanā:] “O Indra and Kutsa, let the steeds convey you two, traveling by chariot, right here close to our face [/lit. ear]. You two blow him [=Śuṣṇa?] out of the water, out of his seat; (by doing this) you two will keep the dark shadows away from the heart of the bounteous one.” It was just this sage poet [=Indra?] who had gone, seeking help, to the yoked horses of the Wind, so easy to yoke. All the Maruts were your partners then, Indra; their sacred formulations strengthened your power. The very chariot of the Sun, (which is) in front, at the decisive turning he will put behind, (though) it is speeding. Etaśa [=the Sun’s horse] bore the wheel; he restores it. Putting (the chariot?) in front (again?), he will gain our intention. This Indra has come here to look about, o peoples, seeking a partner who has pressed the soma. The pressing stone, speaking, will be carried down to the altar—the stone whose nimble (action) the Adhvaryus attend to. Those who take pleasure [/are dear (to you)], they shall take pleasure now [/shall be dear]. The mortals, o immortal one—let them not encounter constraint. Cherish the worshipful ones and place strength among these your peoples, among whom may we be."

Who can obstruct his tempestuousness, his power? Alone, unopposable, he bears away riches. Even these two goddesses [=the two world-halves] now bend (away) from fear of his expansion, of Indra’s strength.

They—Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman, Āyu, Indra lord of the R̥bhus, and the Maruts—shall take pleasure in us, or (in those) who with reverences provide a well-plaited (hymn), a praise for Rudra who gives rewards—(they, the gods) in joint enjoyment. You two Aśvins, driving quickest on the flight of the wind, in the flourishing of your chariotry, are to be summoned hither. Or (you priests), present a thought to the lord of heaven [=Rudra], like (soma) stalks to the worshipful. The heavenly victor with Kaṇva as Hotar, (i.e.,) Trita from heaven, and the Wind, and Agni in joint enjoyment, Pūṣan, and all-nourishing Bhaga have come to the (ritual) presentation like those with swiftest horses to a contest. Present your wealth of yoked horses; for help in the quest for wealth a visionary thought should be produced. The Hotar [=Agni] is well disposed because of the ways of (the company of) fire-priests, which are (also?) the ways of you powerful ones, o Maruts. Set Vāyu, who hitches up the chariot, in front; in front the god, the inspired admirer, with your chants— (you,) aiming (straight), serving the truth, (set in front) the creators of plenty. Let them, (like?) good wives, create (plenty) here (in exchange) for our visionary thought. I hasten to the two young maidens of heaven with your praiseworthy fortifying (hymns), with conspicuous chants. Night and Dawn, like ones who know all, through the days convey the sacrifice here for the mortal. I chant for you to the men granting prosperity, to the Lord of the Dwelling-Place, to Tvaṣṭar, as I give; with reverences (I chant) to the trees, the plants, along with the rich Holy Place, in the quest for wealth. Let the mountains behave like family, to thrust out progeny for us— they who are like good heroes. Āptya, admired, always worthy of our sacrifice, the manly one, will strengthen our laud in preeminence. I have praised the embryo of the terrestrial bull, (as) Trita (has praised) the Child of the Waters with a well-twisted (hymn). Agni is sung with fortifying (hymns) like (a horse) at running. Flame-haired, he liquefies the trees. How shall we speak to the great Rudrian (troop) [=Maruts]; what (shall we say) to observant Bhaga, for wealth? Let the waters and the plants help us, and Heaven, the woods, and the mountains whose hair is trees. Let him hear our hymns—the lord of nourishments; he [=Agni] is the vigorous encircler, passing more quickly than a cloud. Let them hear—the Waters, resplendent like the fortifications of a mountain that encloses the offering ladles [=cows]. Just by our knowledge, o great ones [=Maruts], we shall say which are your ways, wondrous ones, as we acquire what is choice. And like birds, those of good essence [=Maruts] swoop down here in pursuit with their fluttering to the mortal held by murderous weapons. I will call on the heavenly and earthly breeds and on the waters for the good battler (/very bounteous one) [=Indra]. Let the days increase and the hymns tipped with gold; let the waters, the conquered floods increase. Step after step old age has been secured for me, either (by her) who is the able Shielding Goddess or by the protectors. Let the mother, the great Rasā, accompany us along with our patrons, she with hands outstretched, with winnings outstretched. How might we ritually serve with reverence those of good drops, the Maruts traveling their ways, at the invitation—the Maruts of advancing fame, at the invitation? Let Ahi Budhnya not set us up to suffer harm. For us let there be winnings at the distribution (of prizes). In just these words now, for the sake of offspring along with cattle, the mortal (seeks to) win you, o gods—the mortal (seeks to) win you here, o gods. Otherwise Dissolution might swallow the secure depository beneficial to this body, my own old age. Might we obtain that favor of yours, o gods, good ones, the nourishing refreshment of the cow, through (this) recitation. That gracious goddess of good drops [/gifts] should come toward us at a run, for our welfare. Let Iḍā, mother of the flock, greet us, or let Urvaśī, along with the rivers. Or Urvaśī Br̥haddivā, being sung, covering herself, (mother) of the (ritual) presentation, mother of Āyu, Of the nourishing prosperity [/of the prosperity of Ūrjavya]—let her accompany us."

Praise him, who has the good arrow and the good bow, who holds sway over every healing remedy. Sacrifice to Rudra for great benevolence; with acts of reverence offer friendship to the god, the lord. The masters of the house, the workmen who have good hands [=R̥bhus?], the wives of the bull, the rivers fashioned for wide extension, Sarasvatī, Br̥haddivā, and Rākā—let the resplendent ones, showing favor, create a wide realm (for us).

May our lovely praise now reach to the thundering, bellowing lord of refreshment [=Parjanya], o singer— to him who, rich in clouds, rich in water, sets in motion the two world-halves with his lightning, as he sprinkles them. May this praise reach up to the Marutian troop, to the youthful sons of Rudra. Desire calls me to wealth with well-being. Praise the unruly ones with dappled horses. May this praise reach to earth, to the midspace, to the trees, to the plants, for wealth. Let every god be easy for me to invoke. Let Mother Earth not set us in disfavor.

The enduring one belonging to lofty heaven, the bestower—let him come with all his succors when he is invoked— clothing himself in his wives, the plants, not neglectful, a bull with tripartite horn, conferring vigor [=Agni]. In the highest, gleaming footstep of the mother of Āyu [=Urvaśī] the admiring abundant [?] ones have come. With their oblations bestowed with reverence, they groom the beloved child [=Agni] in his dwelling place, like the Āyus.

Lovely to be seen for beauty are those (tips [of flame/soma streams]), which are the sun of the lower (realm). (As the possessor) of (those) tips who shines forth (even) for the one who doesn’t impel (largesse), you are a good herdsman, not for deceiving, o strong-willed one. Far beyond the trickeries of magic your name was (set) in truth. The steed does the oblation follow (and) its [=oblation’s] elements are true; the Hotar who goes without harm brings might. Always stretching out along the ritual grass, the bullish child, the unaging youth is placed in the middle with his outgrowth. These (hymns?) of yours, easy to yoke, (go) forth on their course to seek the twinned sisters [= butter offerings/waters], strong through truth, that (go) downward toward yonder one [=Agni/Soma], with reins easy to control, directing everything. Krivi [=Agni/Soma/the poet (<kavi)?] steals (their) names [=butter offerings/waters?] at their precipitous fall. Quivering with your powers of endurance (toward) the one covered with little “twigs” that grasps (you) at the pressing [=firewood/sheep’s fleece?], resounding among the clearly pregnant (females [=plants/ waters/cows]), you beautify yourself at the recitations for the streams, o you with a straight song. Wax strong over the wives, (you who are) alive in the ceremony. Just as he appears, so is he said (to be): They united (him) with his effective shadow in the waters— (him) who wins wideness for us—(wins) the great (earth), the broad expanse, and lofty immovable might that brings good heroes. (When) unwed, he pursues (women); once he has wives, he truly out(strips) (all) contenders with a mind that seeks conflict—(as) the sun, the sage poet. He with his goods near at hand will vanquish the (sun’s) heat and will win shelter for us, which protects (our) patrimony on all sides. He [=poet] pursues the older sonority of the seers by means of (you [=Agni/Soma]), the beacon of this arrangement [=sacrifice]. Among which (females [=waters/cows/insights]) your name (is), in whatever (place) it has been set, he will find it [=sonority of the seers] through his industry. He who makes the journey by himself, he will get it right. The foremost of these (females) has stepped down into the ocean (of soma). The pressing is not harmed into which she is guided. Here the heart of the working poet [?] does not tremble, where the thought is found that is his bond to the purified (soma/fire). For he (has a bond) with the insights of the mental lordship of the one deserving the sacrifice, who speaks just so and aims toward the same goal. With the delightful (poems) [/lusty (warriors)] of the stealthy one we shall win the most expansive prize, to be brought to success only by the wise. (While still) a falcon, (soma) is unboundedness for these (females [=poems/waters/cows]); (when it becomes) the exhilarating drink, it is their girding—for the one deserving the sacrifice, provided with all desirable things, master of artifice. They [=priests] make (the females) set their goal to go to one after the other (of Soma and Agni) in turn. They know (that) unharnessing and drinking in rounds (are) at hand. The one worthy of the sacrifice, always granting, has smashed away hatreds. “Twisted” (here) by the arms [=activity (of you, the priests)], finding (the praise) that is heard, he is surpassingly in partnership with you. He [=Indra] comes in response to both the choice ones [=Agni and Soma], and he is radiant when he has a share in the troop [=Maruts] with their (chariots?) that drive forth easily. Bearing the pressed (soma) of the sacrificer, master of the settlements, he [=poet] is the udder, the ladle of all visionary thoughts. He bears the (two) milk-cows [=Heaven and Earth, or Agni and Soma]; the milk, full of sap, has been brought to perfection. The one who recites following (his teacher), he learns, not the one who sleeps. Who stays awake, him the verses desire; who stays awake, to him go the melodies. Who stays awake, to him does this Soma say: “I am at home in fellowship with you.” Agni stays awake: him the verses desire. Agni stays awake: to him go the melodies. Agni stays awake: to him does this Soma say, “I am at home in fellowship with you.”"

O sovereign kings, sprinkle us with milk from heaven. O Mitra and Varuṇa, Parjanya speaks his refreshment-bringing word, shimmering and shattering. The Maruts clothe themselves in clouds by your cunning. Make heaven rain, ruddy and spotless. According to your nature, o Mitra and Varuṇa who perceive inspired words, you two guard your commandments by the cunning of a lord. By truth you rule over the whole living world. You place the sun here in heaven as your shimmering chariot."

He stretched out the midspace upon the trees, the prize of victory in the steeds, the milk in the ruddy (cows); Varuṇa placed resolve in hearts, fire in waters, the sun in heaven, and soma on the stone. Varuṇa has poured out the cask with its opening below upon the two world-halves and the midspace. By this he is king of the whole living world. Like rain the barley, he soaks the land. He soaks the land, the earth, and heaven. When Varuṇa wishes milk to flow, then surely it does: the mountains cloak themselves with the rain cloud; showing their might, the heroes [=the Maruts?] let themselves loose. I proclaim this great cunning of the lordly, famed Varuṇa, who, standing in the midspace as if with a measuring rod, measured out earth with the sun. And now no one defies this great cunning of the foremost sage poet, the god: that the mottled streams, pouring out, do not fill the single sea with water. O Varuṇa, the offense that we have committed against any partner, be he one by alliance or one by custom, or against a brother, or against a neighbor—whether native or foreign—o Varuṇa, loosen that. If (we have cheated) as gamblers cheat in a dice game, whether overtly or whether we are unaware, unbind all these things (so they will be) like loose things, o god.

O son of strength, (hold out) riches among mortals, hold out shelter of great extent to Vītahavya, of great extent to Bharadvāja.

Agni kindled with kindling wood do I hymn with a hymn—the blazing pure one in front, steadfast at the ceremony, inspired poet, Hotar of many favors, without deceit—the sage poet we beseech with appeals for grace as Jātavedas. You, Agni, have they established in every generation as immortal messenger, as oblation-conveyor, as protector to be reverently invoked. Both gods and mortals set down with homage the wakeful one as their far-extending clanlord. Seeking manifestation, o Agni, following the commandments of both (men and gods) you speed between the two airy realms altogether. Since we choose for ourselves your thought as grace, so become a kindly provider of threefold defense for us. Him, of lovely countenance, of lovely appearance, of lovely outlook, might we, who do not know, serve as the one who knows better.

Let the smoke-enwrapped (oblation) come entirely to you, to the fold (of the gods); let thousandfold desirable wealth (come) entirely. Agni is the Hotar, the houselord; he is the king. He knows all the creatures, as Jātavedas. He who is of gods and of mortals the best sacrificer, let him, the truthful one, set the sacrifice in motion. O Agni, pure-flamed Hotar of the ceremony, when today you pursue (the oblations) of the clan—for you are the sacrificer— you will offer true (hymns?) as sacrifice when you have become manifest in your greatness. O youngest one, convey the oblations that are yours today. For you watch over the well-placed pleasurable offerings then. One should set you down, to sacrifice to the two world-halves.

This Agni here the ritual adepts churn, as Atharvan (did)— (Agni) who, (though) he sought a crooked (path), they led here unerring from the dark (places). Be born, to pursue the gods in their entirety, for well-being. Convey the gods hither, the immortals growing strong through truth. You cause the sacrifice to touch the gods. O Agni, houselord of the people(s), we have made you lofty with kindling wood. May our household (arrangements) not be “one-horse.” With your sharp sharpness hone us thoroughly."

You are the Hotar established by Manu, the conveyor (of oblations) with your mouth, the very wise one. Agni, sacrifice to the clans of heaven.

Good is your manifestation, Agni, for the prospering mortal— (the manifestation) of (you) the immortal, o child of nourishment. Acccording to your will let the giver be best off, winning you today, acquiring a good legacy. The mortal has achieved a (hymn) with a good twist. Those aided by you, Agni, (are ones) prospering through their whole lifetime, overcoming the hostilities of the stranger, vanquishing the hostilities of the stranger. Agni with his sharp flame will run down every rapacious one. Agni will win us wealth. Wealth in good heroes bring here, o unbounded Jātavedas. Smash the demonic forces, o you of good resolve. You—protect us from narrow straits, o Jātavedas, from the one who bears malice. Guard us, o poet of the sacred formulation. The mortal of evil ways who will deliver us to the murderous weapon, o Agni, from him protect us and from narrow straits. You, god—deflect with your tongue that evil-doer, the mortal who wishes to smash us. To Bharadvāja hold out shelter of great extent, o overpowering Agni, and goods worthy to be chosen. Agni will keep smashing obstacles, seeking chattels, amid admiration— kindled, blazing when bepoured (with ghee)— In the womb of his mother, as the father of his father, having flashed forth at the imperishable (syllable?), sitting on the birthplace of truth— Bring here a sacred formulation bestowing offspring, o unbounded Jātavedas, o Agni, (a formulation) that will shine in heaven. Toward you of delightful appearance, have we, affording (you) pleasure, released our songs, o might-made Agni. Toward your shelter we have come, as if into shadow from the (sun’s) heat, o Agni of golden appearance— You who, like a powerful sharpshooter, like a sharp-horned buffalo, have broken strongholds, o Agni. Whom they carry like a bangle on the hand, like an infant just born, Agni, who conducts good ceremonies for the clans, (That) god carry forward, to pursue the gods, (him) the best finder of goods.

The mortal who with pursuit would seek friendship with the god, he, offering oblations at the ceremony, should reverently invoke Agni. With outstretched hands he should seek to win with homage the Hotar whose sacrifice comes true in the two world-halves. Here to you, Agni, we bring with a verse an oblation fashioned by our heart: let the oxen, bulls, and mated cows be yours. Agni do the gods kindle at the front, as the best obstacle-smasher by whom goods are brought here and the demonic powers crushed—by the prizewinner."

Nothing at all had he left over from the meal. A whole lifetime of great deception was set aside when Śuṣṇa was felled at the flying of the mace. Sharing the same chariot, Indra made a wide way for Kutsa, the sharer of his chariot, at the winning of the sun.

You split open the fortified strongholds of Pipru, who had the tricks of a snake, o mace-bearer, as if with swelling strength. O generous giver, you gave that legacy not to be spurned as a gift to the pious R̥jiśvan. Indra showed the favor of his dominance to Vetasu of the ten tricks and ten arms and to the thrusting (Tuji), (saying,) “Tugra as perpetual vassal for brilliant (Vetasu) shall I dispatch, like (calves) to their mother, to go (to him).” Unopposable, he will vanquish the contenders, bearing his Vr̥tra-smashing mace in his fist. He mounts his two fallow bays, like an archer upon his chariot seat; those yoked by speech convey lofty Indra. Might we win anew through your help, Indra. The Pūrus start up the praise with this (hymn) along with sacrifices. When he split the seven autumnal strongholds, their shelter, he smote the Dāsa (clans), doing his best for Purukutsa.

You, the tumultuous one, Indra, set the tumultuous waters in motion, flowing like streams. When you will cross the sea, o hero, make Turvaśa and Yadu cross to well-being. Everything in the contest is yours, Indra. Dhuni and Cumuri sleep, whom you put to sleep.

Much-invoked one, take cognizance of the one who is closest. The closer ones, asking about him, have guided themselves following your distant, ancient (acts) worthy of fame, Indra. As far as we know it, that far we chant to you as the great one, you hero with the sacred formulation as your vehicle. The face of the demon has spread out against you, who were born great. Stand up to it well! With your ancient, conjoined comrade, your mace, o bold one, thrust these away. Listen, Indra, to the current (bard) creating sacred formulations, you hero who give succor to bards— for you, as the friend of our ancestors in olden days, have always been easy to invoke in the quest. Bring forward for help Varuṇa, Mitra, Indra, and the Maruts, to help us today, forward Pūṣan, Viṣṇu, Agni and Plenty, Savitar, the plants, and the mountains. These singers here with their chants chant to you, o you of many talents, receiving the first of the sacrifice. Listen to the call of him who calls you here as you are called. Immortal one, there exists no one like you, other than you. Now drive here, right up to my speech, since you know, o son of strength, together with all those worthy of the sacrifice, who had Agni as their tongue and served the truth, who put Manu very close to Dasa. Become a leader for us on easy roads and on difficult ones, since you are known as a path-maker. The broad, unflagging (horses), the best conveyors—with them convey the prize to us, o Indra."

You who seek friendship—hear what is worthy to be heard: Like heaven over the earth, sur(mount) the riches of the stranger, so that you will keep finding enjoyment in us and you will keep showing yourself with your strength and your vigor generation after generation."

It will sound— when speaking of Indra, it thunders: this invocation to the gods should turn him—Indra—here toward me, this one just now being recited. With my highest insight, with my recitations I have roared for you to ageless Indra, born of old. Not only have the sacred formulations and the songs together been placed in him, but in Indra the great praise puts strength. Indra, whom the sacrifice will strengthen and the soma, (whom) the sacred formulation will strengthen, and the songs, solemn words, and thoughts— so strengthen him at the coming of dawn from night.

Our newer ally [=Soma] has found the skill. Having been drunk, he has perceived what is better for the gods.

Indra, we have become ready just for you, the giver, you generous possessor of the fallow bays. Do not lose the track. No one has shown himself as our friend among mortals. Do they not call you a rouser (even) of the weak? Give us not to exhaustion, bull. Let us not come to harm in our comradeship with you, the wealthy. Many are the tributes for you among the peoples, Indra. Smite the non-pressers; rip away those who don’t deliver. Like the thunderer the rain clouds, Indra stirs up bounties of horses and cattle. It is you who provide nourishment to the bard from of old. Let those without gifts not trick you away from (our) benefactor. O Adhvaryu, hero, give of the pressed (soma drinks) to great Indra, for he is its king, he who has grown strong by the previous and the present songs of singing seers. In its exhilaration, knowing many shapes, Indra smashed unopposable obstacles. Pour forth for him the honeyed soma, for the belipped hero to drink. Let Indra be the one who drinks the pressed soma, who smashes the obstacle [/Vr̥tra] with his mace in his exhilaration, who goes to the sacrifice, even from far away, who is the good helper of insights, providing nourishment to the bard. Here is this drinking cup, giving drink to Indra. Indra’s dear immortal (drink) has been drunk, so that it will exhilarate the god for the sake of his good favor and will keep hatred and constraint away from us. Becoming exhilarated by it, o champion, smash your rivals and your foes, both kin and non-kin, o bounteous one. Those with weapons aimed at us, setting their sights on us—pulverize and smash them, Indra, (for them to become) far away. Once more, in these our battles, bounteous Indra, make for us a great wide space and easy passage. Go halves with our patrons, Indra, in the conquering of the waters, of life and lineage. Your fallow bays, the bulls that have been yoked, the steeds with their bullish chariot and with their bullish reins, the bulls that convey your mace—let them, well-yoked, convey you here in our direction for bullish exhilaration. The bulls have mounted the wooden cup for you, o bull, like waves spraying ghee as they bring exhilaration. Indra, to you, the bullish bull, they present soma from out of the (drops) pressed by bulls. You are the bullish bull of heaven and of earth, the bullish bull of the rivers and of the standing waters. O bull, for bullish you the drop has swelled, the sweet sap, the honeyed drink, to your liking. This god here, being born with strength, with Indra as his yokemate, blocked the Paṇi [/niggard]. This one here, the drop, stole the weapons of his own father, the tricks of the unkindly one. This one gave the dawns a good husband; this one placed light within the sun. This one found the threefold immortal one hidden in heaven among the third realms of light. This one propped apart heaven and earth; this one yoked the chariot with seven reins. This one, Soma, by his ability, secures the cooked (milk) within the cows, the wellspring with its ten fastenings: Soma!"

Hear our call! With insights as our steeds, (might we win) steeds and prizes worthy of fame, o Indra; with you might we win the stake that is set. You became great when the stake was set, o Indra, you hero who longs for songs, and the one worth tussling for at the raid. Your help that has the quickest speed, o smasher of foes— with that impel our chariot. As the best charioteer, with our chariot on the attack, win, o winner, the stake that is set. Praise only him, who alone was born as the limitless lord of the separate peoples, having a bullish will. You who were the only friend with help, the kindly comrade of the singers, have mercy on us, Indra. Set your mace in your hands to smash the demons, mace-bearer. You should overpower your opponents. The ancient yokemate of riches, the comrade who spurs on the weak, the one who most has the sacred formulation as his vehicle—upon him do I call. For he alone is lord of all the good things of the earth, the rich one who most longs for songs. (Coming) here with your teams, fulfill our desire with prizes of horses and of cows, lord of cows, acting boldly. Sing this at the pressing to the warrior called upon by many, (this) that is weal for the able one as if for a cow. The good one will not hold back his gift of a prize of cattle when he will hear these songs. For the smiter of Dasyus will certainly go forth to somebody’s cattle enclosure; with his powers he will open it up. These songs bellow out again and again to you, o you of a hundred resolves, like mothers to their calf, Indra. Partnership with you is difficult to attain. You are, o hero, the cow for him who seeks cattle. Become the horse for him who seeks horses. Find exhilaration from the stalk, then, to show great generosity with your own person. You will not put your praiser to scorn. These songs come near to you at every pressing, o you who long for songs, as milk-cows do their calf— (You,) the first among many at the verbal contest of the many praiser-singers, who compete for the prize with their prizes. Let ours be the praise song that best conveys you nearest, Indra. Impel us toward great wealth. Br̥bu has stood upon the highest head of the niggards [/Paṇis]; (he is) as broad of girth as the Ganges— (He) whose propitious gift in the thousands, at a speed like the wind’s, is ready for giving all at once.

This sweet one here was the most exhilarating, on which Indra became exhilarated for the smashing of Vr̥tra, he who (having performed) many exploits smashed apart the nine and ninety walls of Śambara. This one, when it is drunk, rouses my speech; it has awakened an eager inspired thought. This wise one measured out the six broad (realms), from which no world is at a distance. This is the one who created the expanse of the earth; who created the height of heaven is this one here; this one (created) the beestings on the three slopes [=worlds?]. Soma upheld the broad midspace. This one found the flood with its brilliant appearance at the (fore)front of the dawns with their gleaming seats. This one, great, with a great pillar propped up heaven—he, the bull, accompanied by the Maruts. Boldly drink the soma in the tub, Indra—as smasher of Vr̥tra at the confluence of goods, o champion. At the Midday Pressing, drench yourself. Standing amid wealth, establish wealth in us. Indra, look forward for us, like the man who goes ahead; lead us further forward, toward a better state. Become one of good passage, who gives us passage beyond; become one of good guidance and valued guidance. Lead us along to a wide world, as the one who knows—to sun-filled light, to fearlessness, to well-being. High are the arms of you who are stalwart, Indra. Might we approach these two lofty shelters. Place us in the widest chariot box, Indra, on the two best-pulling horses, you possessor of hundreds. Convey hither the highest refreshment of refreshments. Let our (refreshment) not cross over to the “riches of the stranger,” bounteous one. Indra, be gracious. Seek a means of life for me. Spur on my poetic vision like a blade of copper. Whatever I say here in devotion to you, just this enjoy. Make me accompanied by the gods. Indra the protector, Indra the helper, Indra the champion good to call at every call— I call on Indra, the able one, called on by many. Let bounteous Indra establish well-being for us. Let Indra be of good protection, of good help with his help, very gracious, affording all possessions. Let him thrust away hatred; let him create fearlessness. Might we be lords of good heroes in abundance. Might we be in the favor of him who deserves the sacrifice, in his propitious benevolence. Let Indra of good protection, of good help to us keep hatred away even from a distance. Down to you, Indra, run the hymns and the sacred formulations as teams, like a wave along the slopes. As broad as your bounty are the many pressings. You join together the waters, the cows, and the drops, you possessor of the mace. Who will praise him, who will fill him, who will sacrifice to him, if the bounteous one would always help only the strong? Like one who puts down his two feet one after the other, with his powers he makes the one who was behind to be in front. He is famed as a hero who subdues every strong one, continually leading the one beyond the other in turn. Hating the flashy, king of both (races [=human and divine]), Indra keeps prodding the clans, the sons of Manu—first one, then the other. He twists away from his partnerships with those in front; continually double-crossing them, he goes with those behind. Indra keeps enduring through the many autumns, shaking them [=autumns] off so they don’t close in. He has a form corresponding to every form; this form of his is for display. Indra keeps going about in many forms through his magical powers, for ten hundred fallow bays are yoked for him. Having yoked the two fallow bay mares to his chariot, Tvaṣṭar rules over the many (forms) here. Who will always sit on the side of the hostile—and especially when (our) patrons are sitting (a sacrificial session)? We have come here to a field without pasturage, o gods. Though it was wide, the land has become narrow. O Br̥haspati, o Indra, be on the lookout for a path for the singer who is in this state on his quest for cattle. Day after day he drove off from their seat the other half, the black kindred all of the same appearance. The bull smashed the two Dāsas, mercenaries, Varcin and Śambara, at the moated place. Prastoka from your bounty, Indra, has just now given ten casks, ten prizewinners. From Divodāsa, (son?) of Atithigva, we have accepted as bounty the goods belonging to Śambara. Ten horses, ten casks, ten garments, with delights on top— ten golden balls have I gained from Divodāsa. Ten chariots with side-horses, a hundred cows has Aśvatha given to the Atharvans, to Pāyu. The descendant of Sr̥ñjaya has reached toward the Bharadvājas, who have acquired great bounty belonging to all people. O tree, because you should become firm-limbed, a comrade to us, furthering (us), affording good heroes, you are knotted together with cows [=leather (straps)]. Be firm! Let the one who mounts you win what is to be won. Strength has been brought up from heaven, from earth; might has been brought here from the trees. To the strongness of the waters enclosed by cows, to the mace of Indra—to the Chariot—sacrifice with an oblation. The mace of Indra, the face of the Maruts, the embryo of Mitra, the navel of Varuṇa— taking pleasure in this oblation-giving of ours, god Chariot, accept our oblations. Make Heaven and Earth gasp. Let the moving (world [=living creatures]) dispersed in many places pay attention to you. O Drum, along with Indra, with the gods, drive away the rivals farther than far. Roar out your power. Set strength in us. Thunder down, thrusting away difficulties. Blast away misfortunes from here, o Drum. You are the fist of Indra: be firm! Drive those yonder [=cows] hither and make the ones here turn back. The Drum keeps speaking, giving the signal. Our men, with horses as their wings, are converging: (so) let our charioteers win, o Indra."

And certainly don’t (tear off the wheel) of the sun: for thus never could you give pursuit to the one who ‘puts the necks’ (of the horses to the chariot-pole?). “Let (us) have a partnership that keeps the wolf away, with you who are like a leather bag— an unsplit one that holds curds, a well-filled one that holds curds.” For you are beyond mortals and equal with the gods in your splendor. Keep an eye on us in our battles, Pūsan. Help us now, just as before. O you shakers, let (us) have the valuable guidance of a valuable one and let there be the liberal spirit either of a god or of a mortal who has sacrificed, o Maruts who receive the forefront of the sacrifice. He whose acclaim goes around heaven even in a single day, like the god Sun, the Maruts assume his vibrant power, his sacrificial name—his Vr̥tra-smashing power, his preeminent Vr̥tra-smashing power. Only once was Heaven born; only once was Earth born. Only once was the milk of Pr̥śni milked. Another (of the Maruts) is not born after this."

Let them come hither; let them listen here—those of good dominion, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni. The one to be reverently invoked at the ceremonies of every clan, of undistracted resolve, the spoked wheel of the two youthful ones [=Heaven and Earth], the child of Heaven, the son of strength—Agni—the ruddy beacon of the sacrifice (I invoke) to perform sacrifice. The two daughters of the ruddy one, differing in form: the one is ornamented with stars, the other is the sun’s. The two pure ones, transiting alternately, wandering apart—being hymned they both approach the prayerful thought once it is heard. A lofty inspired thought (goes) forth to Vāyu, who, possessing lofty wealth and all valuables, fills the chariot. Having a brilliant course, master of teams, as poet you seek to reach the poet, you who are worshiped at the forefront of the sacrifice. That seems to me a wonder—the chariot of the Aśvins, radiant, yoked with mind, by which you two, Nāsatyas, superior men, drive your circuit, for our descendants and ourselves to prosper. Parjanya [/Thunder] and Vāta [/Wind], you two bulls of the earth, quicken the watery outpourings (for him [=human poet]) through whose hymns—you poets who really hear [=Maruts] and you mounter of the moving world [=Indra]—you made the moving world your own. The daughter of Pavīru, the maiden with a brilliant lifespan, Sarasvatī, whose husband is a hero, will confer poetic insight. Together with the (divine) ladies she will hold out to the singer unbroken shelter, protection difficult to assail. I will direct my eloquence to the complete protector of every path. Prompted by desire, he has attained the chant. He will bestow on us proliferating riches tipped with gold; he will cause every visionary thought to reach its goal—Pūṣan. To him who receives the first portion, the glorious conferrer of vigor, the skillful god with lovely palms and lovely hands who deserves the sacrifice of the dwelling places—to Tvaṣṭar easy to invoke will far-radiant Agni, the Hotar, sacrifice. The father of creation: with these hymns strengthen Rudra by day, Rudra by night; the lofty, high, ageless, very gracious one would we invoke separately, roused by the poet. You youths, poets deserving the sacrifice, you Maruts—come hither in response to the singer’s longing for space, for you in your strength quicken even (a place) without brightness, approaching in just the same way as to Aṅgiras, you superior men. Forth to the hero, forth to the powerful, precipitous one will I drive (praise?), as a guardian of livestock drives his flocks home. He will make the inspired words of the speaker touch the body of him who is famed, as one makes the firmament touched by stars. He who measured out the earthly realms three times exactly, for Manu, who was hard-pressed—Viṣṇu— in this shelter of yours (still) being offered might we rejoice with wealth, with life and lineage. Let Ahi Budhnya take delight in this (praise?) of ours, along with the waters and the chants; in this let the Mountain, in this let Savitar take delight; let the Gift-Escorts, let Fortune, let Plenitude quicken this along with the plants, for wealth. Now to us give wealth in chariots, filling the settled domains, consisting of many heroes, the herdsmen of great truth; give ageless peaceful dwelling (and that) with which we will trample upon the (other) peoples, the godless contenders, with which we will take on the godless clans."

And, Heaven and Earth, you two very gracious world-halves—you will make broad, lofty dominion as shelter great(ly), so that there will be a faultless wide realm for our peaceful dwelling, you two Holy Places. Let the sons of Rudra incline themselves to us here, the unassailable good ones invoked today, since we, placed in petty or in great distress, have called upon the Maruts, the gods— The ones to whom the goddess Rodasī is joined, on whom Pūṣan attends, sharing the sacrifice by halves. O Maruts, when, on having heard our call, you make your drive, the worlds tremble at your agitated course. Chant to this hero who has a yearning for songs—to Indra with a new sacred formulation, o singer. He will hear the call. While being praised and being greatly hymned, he will give rewards. O Waters belonging to Manu, establish unimpaired succor as luck and lifetime for our offspring and descendants. For you are the most motherly healers, the begetters of everything still and moving. God Savitar, who gives protection, should come hither to us—the golden-palmed one deserving the sacrifice, who, rich in gifts, like the face of Dawn discloses valuables to the pious. And you, Son of Strength—you should turn the gods hither to us today to this ceremony here. Might I be always within (the sphere of) your giving; by your help might I possess good heroes, Agni. And you Nāsatyas should come here to my summons with your insightful thoughts—you certainly are inspired poets. (As you did) Atri from great darkness, release (me)—triumph, men!— from difficulty at close quarters. Become for us givers of wealth that is brilliant, rich in prizes, in men, in much livestock. Showing favor, o gods—the heavenly, earthly, cow-born, and watery ones—be merciful. Let those who grant rewards be merciful to us in concord—Rudra and Sarasvatī, Viṣṇu, Vāyu, the Master of the R̥bhus, Vāja, the divine Distributor. Let Parjanya [/Thunder] and Vāta [/Wind] swell refreshments for us. And this god Savitar and Bhaga and the Child of the Waters—let (each) help us, supplying gifts, and Tvaṣṭar jointly with the divine ones, the Wives, Heaven with the gods, Earth with the seas. And let Ahi Budhnya hear us and Aja Ekapad, Earth, Sea, and all the gods, strong through truth, when they are invoked and praised. Let the solemn utterances, pronounced by poets, help (us). In just this way the Bharadvājas, the descendants of me, this Mamata, chant with their insightful thoughts, with their chants.

The two attend upon the thoughts of (me), the newer singer, having harnessed their team, conveying beauty and fortifying power, refreshment and nourishment. The age-old Hotar without deceit shall offer sacrifice to the two youths. The two, obliging and skillful, best endowed with many abilities—those age-old ones do I seek to attract here with my newer speech— those two who become most wealful for the reciter and praiser, providing bright gifts to the singer. You two with your birds conveyed Bhujyu, the son of Tugra, from the waters, from the sea, through the airy realms, through dustless treks, bending (him) away from the lap of the flood with your winged ones. With your victorious (chariot), you charioteers drove through the rock; you harkened to the call of Vadhrīmatī, o bulls. Showing favor to Śayu, you made his cow swell. Thus (did you show) your benevolence, you stirring and bustling ones. O world-halves, the anger of gods and among mortals that exists from of old on earth, direct that evil heat at the yokemate of demons, o Ādityas, Vasus, and Rudriyas. Which (one of) the two kings, Mitra or Varuṇa, will keep watch over the airy realm, regulating it according to the proper sequence— hurl your missile at the deep-embedded demonic power and also at the deceitful speech of the Anu people. With your wheels drawing nearer, with your heaven-bright chariot with its superior men, do you two drive your circuit for our lineage (to prosper), because of the distant dereliction of a(nother) mortal. Chop off the heads of the rapacious ones. Drive here with your highest and midmost teams, this way with your lowest. Open the doors of the cattle pen, even though they are shut fast, you who provide bright gifts for the singer."

Let the birds, the horses that convey best, convey you to the pleasurable offering, o Nāsatyas. Your chariot swift as thought has been sent surging forth after the many refreshments and the fortifying powers that bring refreshment. Because your giving is much, o you who give much enjoyment, swell our cow and our refreshment (so that they) don’t dry up. To you belong praises and the good praise-hymn and the juices that have followed your gift, o honeyed ones. And mine are two silver, swift (mares) of Puraya, a hundred (cows) at (the hands of) Sumīḷha, and cooked (foods) at (the hands of) Peruka. Śāṇḍa has given gold-bedecked (horses) along with their allotted (gear). Ten mated cows are attendant upon the high (horses).

Agni, burn away all hostile powers with the heat by which you burned Jarūtha. Make sickness disappear without a sound. O best Agni—flaming, shining, pure—he who will kindle your face here— also because of these praise songs (of his) you should be here for us. Our ancestral, mortal men, who shared among themselves your face many times, o Agni— also because of these you should be favorable here to us. Let these men, champions at the smashing of obstacles, prevail over all ungodly wiles— they who marvel at my insight that is proclaimed. Agni, let us not sit in the absence of men, nor (let us sit) around you without posterity because of a lack of heroes [=sons] amid (other) houses filled with offspring, o you belonging to the house— (Let Agni approach) our dwelling, which the horseman [=Agni] approaches as his own to sacrifice, (a dwelling) filled with offspring and endowed with a good lineage, having increased by our own kin’s posterity. Protect us, Agni, from the detestable demon. Protect us from the crookedness of the ungenerous and malicious one. With you as my yokemate, I would prevail over those doing battle (with me). Let this very Agni be superior to other fires, here where there gather a prizewinning horse, a strong-handed lineage, and the syllable [/the inexhaustible cow] with a thousand cattle-shelters. This very Agni, who protects against the rapacious ones, should free his kindler from constriction. Well-born men circle around him. Here is that Agni, receiving poured oblations in many places, whom the master kindles, bringing the offering, and whom the Hotar goes around at the rites. In you, Agni, as masters we would pour many oblations that are your own, as we make the twin bridal processions at the sacrificial meal. And, Agni, these oblations are most sought: unwearying, convey them to the divine assembly. Let them [=the gods] seek these, our sweet-scented (oblations). Agni, do not hand us over to a lack of men. To neglect with its shabby dress—do not hand us over to this. Do not (hand) us (over) to hunger nor to the demon, o you who possess the truth. Do not be angry at us in our house or in the forest. Now direct my formulations upward, Agni. O god, you will sweeten them for our generous (patrons). We on both sides [=priests and patrons] would be in your generosity. – Do you protect us always with your blessings. O Agni, you are of easy summons and joy-bringing appearance. Be brilliant with good brilliance, o son of strength. In company with you, let there be no falling short for our own lineage. Let not the manly hero fade away among us. Do not declare that we maintain them badly, Agni, since these fires are kindled by the gods. Let not bad thoughts from you, a god, reach us, not even because of our confusion, o son of strength. That mortal is rich, o Agni of beautiful face, who pours the oblation in the immortal one. He [=Agni or the mortal] establishes him [=the mortal or Agni] as one who gains goods among the gods, the one to whom the inquiring patron goes, seeking his ends. Since you know of the great, easy passage, Agni, convey here to our patrons lofty wealth, by which, o powerful one, we would rejoice as those undiminished in lifetime and having abundant good heroes. Now direct my formulations upward, Agni. O god, you will sweeten them for our generous (patrons). We on both sides would be in your generosity. – Do you protect us always with your blessings."

And the two great, heavenly young women, Dawn and Night, like a milk-cow that gives good milk, the two generous ones sitting on the ritual grass, summoned by many, worthy of the sacrifice—let them rest here for our safe passage. I think you two inspired praise poets [=divine Hotars] at the sacrifices of the sons of Manu are both Jātavedas and are to perform the sacrifice. Raise up our rite at our calls. You will win desirable rewards (for us) among the gods. Bhāratī along with the Bhāratīs, Iḷā along with the gods, Agni along with the sons of Manu, and Sarasvatī along with the Sārasvatas are near: let the three goddesses sit here on the ritual grass. O god Tvaṣṭar, unbind for us this flow of semen and what prospers, granting (that) from which a hero is born, fit for action and very skilled, who yokes up the pressing stones and desires the gods. O Lord of the Forest, send it [=the sacrificial animal] to the gods. Agni, the Śamitar-priest, will sweeten the offering. And it is he, the more real Hotar [=Agni], who will offer sacrifice, since he knows the births of the gods. Journey near here, o Agni, as you are kindled, on the same chariot with Indra and the swift gods. Let Aditi of good sons sit on our ritual grass. Svāhā! Let the immortal gods rejoice!"

Because you are simply dwelling peacefully like a king with his wives, help (us) throughout the days, being preeminent as a wise poet. O bounteous one, ornament our hymns with cows and horses; whet us, who are devoted to you, for wealth. These gladdening hymns, contending with each other here, seeking the gods, have reverently approached you. Let the path of your wealth lead our way. Might we be in your good thought, Indra, in your shelter. Wishing to milk you like a milk-cow in good pasture, I, Vasiṣṭha, have dispatched sacred formulations to you. Everyone says that you alone are my herdsman. Let Indra come to our good thought. Even the floods that had spread out—Indra made them into fords easy to cross for Sudās. Śimyu, who was vaunting himself above our newer speech—he [=Indra] made him into the flotsam of the rivers and his taunts (too). Turvaśa Yakṣu (the “sacrificer”) was himself the offering cake—also the Matsyas [“fish”], whetted down (in their quest) for wealth, like fish in water. The Bhr̥gus and the Druhyus (just) followed orders. (Former) comrade crossed (former) comrade on the two opposing (sides). The Pakthas [“cooked oblations”?] and the Bhalānases [“raiders”?] spoke out, and the Alinas, the Viṣānins, and the Śivas: “The feasting companion of the Ārya [=Indra?], who led (us?) hither— with desire for cattle for the Tr̥tsus he has gone with battle against superior men [=us].” The ill-intentioned ones without insight, causing Aditi to abort, diverted (the course of) the (river) Paruṣṇī. With his greatness he [=Indra? Turvaśa?] enveloped the earth, being master (of it). The poet lay there, being perceived as (just) a (sacrificial) animal. They came to the Paruṣṇī, to a failed end as if to their (real) goal. Not even the swift one made it home for supper. Indra made those without alliance (to us) subject to Sudās, those, easy to thrust away, who, (though) in Manu’s (race), were of gelded speech. They went like cows without a cowherd from a pasture, (though) seeming (to go) to an alliance properly concluded— the Pr̥śnigus, propelled down to the dappled one [/P(a)r(u)ṣṇī]. The teams and the battlers [?] followed orders. He who as king with desire for fame has strewn down the one and twenty peoples of the two Vaikarṇas, just as a wonder-worker “whets down” the ritual grass on the seat. The champion Indra made a gush of them. Then famous old Kavaṣa he wrenched down into the waters, and *Anu and Druhyu—he with the mace in his arms. The ones devoted to you, who cheered you on, (were) choosing there your partnership for their partnership. In an instant Indra split open all their fortified places, their seven strongholds, with his might. He shared out the patrimony of the descendant of Anu to Tr̥tsu. We defeated the Pūru of scornful speech at the rite of distribution. The cow-seeking Anu and Druhyu people fell down to sleep—sixty hundred, six thousand (of them). (But on the other side there were just) sixty heroes with six on top, in search of (Indra’s) favor. All these are the manly deeds of Indra. These Tr̥tsus, constantly laboring alongside Indra, ran like waters released downward. The ill-allied ones, meting (their supplies) out with a miser’s eye, (yet) left behind all their goodies for Sudās. The (mere) half a hero, who drinks the cooked oblation without Indra, who vaunts himself, did he thrust away to the ground. Indra confounded the battle fury of the one who confounds the battle fury (of others). He took to the course of the path, being master of it. Even with a feeble thing he performed this unique (deed): he smote even the lioness with a wether. Indra hewed down the poles with a pin. He handed over all the goodies to Sudās. “Because one after the other, the rivals become subject to you, procure the subjugation even of vaunting Bheda. Who(ever) commits an offense against mortals who praise, smash your sharp mace down on him, o Indra.” The Yamunā (River) helped Indra, as did the Tr̥tsus. He despoiled Bheda there entirely, and the Ajas, Śighras, and the Yakṣus brought horses’s heads as tribute. Neither your favors nor your riches, o Indra, can be entirely surveyed, through the previous dawns, nor through the current ones. You smote even the one who fancied himself a little god. You cut down Śambara from the lofty (mountain) by yourself. Those from (this?) house who reached elation in devotion to you— Parāśara, Śatayātu, Vasiṣṭha— they did not neglect their partnership with you, who provided for (them). So now day-bright (dawns) will dawn forth for the patrons. Two hundred (head) of cattle from the descendant of Devavant, two chariots carrying brides from Sudās— deserving the gift of Paijavana, o Agni, I circle around (it), like a Hotar the seat (of the sacrificial victim), as I “rasp” [=sing]. The four gift(-horse)s of Paijavana, along with their allotted (gear), covered with pearls, (convey) me exclusively. The silvery ones of Sudās who tread the earth convey me and my progeny, for my progeny to be famed. He whose fame the Apportioner has apportioned to every head between the two wide world-halves, they hymn (him) just as the seven streams do Indra. He “whetted down” Yudhyāmadhi at the moment of encounter. You superior men, you Maruts, accompany this (man) here, like Divodāsa, the father of Sudās. Give aid to the aspiration of Paijavana—lordly power difficult to attain and unaging—(as he) seeks (your) favor."

You are armor of broad extent and a fighter in the front, o Vr̥tra-smasher. With you as yokemate, I respond to (the challenger). And you are great, you to whose might the two autonomous world-halves have yielded, o Indra. The choir of Maruts, your fellow travelers, surrounds you, reaching you all together throughout the days. The (soma) drops aloft in heaven come close to you, the wondrous one; the communities jointly bow to you. (Sacrificers,) bear forth your (offering) for the great one of great strengthening; for the forethoughtful one put forth your good thought. (Indra,) fare forth to the many clans, as the one filling up the settled domains. For the great one of broad expanse, for Indra, the inspired poets begat a (hymn) with a good twist, a sacred formulation. His commandments the clever do not transgress. The (Marut) choirs entirely established Indra—just him to whom the battle fury is conceded—as king, to be victorious. Swell his friends altogether for the one of the fallow bays."

Even from afar come here to our joint revelry, or being (already) here hearken (to us), Because these who craft sacred formulations for you sit like flies on honey when (the soma) is pressed. The singers, seeking goods, set their desire on Indra, like a foot on a chariot. Desirous of wealth I call upon the one with mace in hand, possessing a good right (hand/horse) [/bringing good priestly gifts], like a son upon his father. These soma drinks here, mixed with curds, have been pressed for Indra. Drive to them with your pair of fallow bays, o you with mace in hand— for exhilaration, for drinking—(as if) to your home. He will listen: he of listening ears is implored for goods. He will never neglect our songs. The one who just in a single day will give hundreds, thousands—no one will confound him when he is about to give. That hero cannot be repulsed—he becomes puffed up by Indra, along with his men— who presses and rinses deep pressings for you, o Vr̥tra-smasher. Be a defense for the bounteous (patrons), bounteous one, when you will herd together those who vaunt themselves. Might we have a share in the possessions of the one slain by you. Bring here the patrimony of the one difficult to get at. Press soma for soma-drinking Indra who holds the mace. Cook cooked dishes. Just cause (him) to help. It is only the generous giver who is a joy to the one who generously gives. You pressers of soma, do not fail; be skillful for the great one. Make (him inclined) to thrust wealth (to us). It is just the surpassing man who wins: he dwells peacefully, he thrives. The gods are not for the petty. No one has encircled the chariot of Sudās [/the good giver], nor stopped it. Whoever has Indra as helper, whoever has the Maruts, he will come to a pen full of cattle. He will come to the prize when he strives for the prize—the mortal whose helper you will be, Indra. Become a helper to our chariots, o champion, to our men. His share now is outstanding like the spoils of a victor. Indra of the fallow bays—cheats do not outwit him. He places skill in the one who has soma. A mantra—not stunted, well arranged, well adorned—set it among those worthy of the sacrifice. The many onslaughts never overcome him who through ritual work comes to be in (the good grace) of Indra. What mortal will dare against him who has you as his possession, Indra? It is with trust in you, bounteous one, that on the decisive day the one vying for the prize seeks to win the prize. At the smashing of obstacles spur on the bounteous ones who give their own dear goods. O you of the fallow bays, with your guidance may we, along with our patrons, overcome all difficulties. Yours alone is the lowest good thing, Indra; you prosper the middling one. You rule over each highest one entirely. No one obstructs you when cattle (are at stake). You are famed as the giver of spoils to everyone, whenever there are (battle-)drives. Every earth-dweller here, when seeking help, desires a share in your name, o you who are invoked by many. If I were lord of as much as you are, Indra, I would seek to make just my praiser (well) set up, you excavator of goods; I would not give him over to ill-estate. I would do my best just for the one who magnifies (the god) every day, to (bring him) wealth here wherever it is to be found, for there exists no other, better friendship for us than you, nor even a father, bounteous one. It is just the surpassing one who seeks to win the prize, as yokemate with Plenitude. I bend Indra, invoked by many, here to you with a song, as a carpenter bends a felly made of good wood. Not by a bad(ly made) praise does a mortal find goods, nor will wealth reach the one who fails. It’s an easy skill for you, bounteous one—giving to the likes of me on the decisive day. We keep bellowing to you, o champion, like unmilked cows— to you, Indra, who see (like) the sun, lord of this moving (world), lord of the still one. There is no other heavenly one like you, nor earthly; neither born, nor to be born. Seeking horses, seeking cows, vying for the prize, we call upon you, bounteous Indra. Bring this greater (good) here, Indra, to those who are lesser, for you, bounteous one, are from of old one with many goods, and the one to be called upon at every raid. Thrust away the foes, bounteous one; make goods easy for us to find. Become a helper for us in (the contest for) great stakes; become a strengthener of our comrades. Indra, bring your resolve to bear for us, like a father for his sons. Do your best for us on this drive, you who are invoked by many. May we, (still) alive, reach the light. Let not communities unknown—ill-intentioned and unkindly disposed—trample us down. With you, o champion, let us cross over the (river-)courses one after another, cross over the waters. ̣"

Over the pressed soma of Pāśadyumna Vāyata he preferred the Vasiṣṭhas. It was certainly just with them that he crossed the Sindhu; certainly just with them that he smashed Bheda [/the “Splitter”]; it was certainly just by reason of your sacred formulation that Indra helped Sudās in the Battle of the Ten Kings, o Vasiṣṭhas. [Indra:] Gladly, you superior men, by reason of your fathers’ sacred formulation, I have engirded the axle: you will certainly not be harmed, since with a lofty cry in Śakvarī [=martial] (meter) you established impetuous force in Indra, o Vasiṣṭhas. Like thirsty ones looking toward heaven (for rain), in distress they looked toward (Indra) when they were surrounded in the Battle of the Ten Kings. Indra hearkened to Vasiṣṭha as he was praising; he made the broad space broad for the Tr̥tsus. They were cut off short, like goads for driving cattle—the puny Bharatas. When Vasiṣṭha came to be the leader, right after that did the clans of the Tr̥tsus spread out. Three produce semen in the world; three creatures belonging to the Ārya have light in front. Three heats accompany the dawn. All these (triads) do they know through and through—the Vasiṣṭhas. Their light is like the waxing of the sun; their greatness is deep as the sea’s; like the speed of the wind, your praise hymn, o Vasiṣṭhas, can be pursued by no other. Only they converge upon the thousand-twigged secret with the insights of their heart. Weaving the covering (garment) stretched by Yama, they reverently approached the Apsarases—the Vasiṣṭhas. When Mitra and Varuṇa saw you as light compacting itself from out of the lightning— that was (one) birth of yours, Vasiṣṭha, and (there was) one when Agastya brought you here for the clan. And you are the descendant of Mitra and Varuṇa, o Vasiṣṭha, born from Urvaśī, from her mind, you formulator. A drop (of semen?) spurted forth: with a heavenly formulation all the gods took you in a lotus. He, foreknowing of both in his insight, possessing a thousand gifts and one gift (more), intending to weave the covering stretched by Yama, was born from the Apsaras—Vasiṣṭha. The two [=Mitra and Varuṇa?], brought into being at a (ritual) Session, aroused by reverences, poured their common semen into a pot. From it arose Māna from the middle. From it they say the seer was born—Vasiṣṭha. [Agastya?:] He supports the supporter of solemn speech [=Hotar], the supporter of the melody [=Udgātar]; supporting the pressing stone he will speak forth at the beginning. Do you reverently approach him, seeking benevolence. He will come to you, you thrusters forth—Vasiṣṭha."

Your cows roll the darkness up altogether; they extend the light, like Savitar his arms. Dawn has come to pass—a bounteous benefactor most like Indra; she has generated fame for good faring.

He will carry us across the parched places unharmed. The recitation enjoyable to the immortal one—these immortals here, born of old, have imparted it to us. We would invoke the brightly roaring one, worthy of the sacrifice of the dwelling places, unassailing Br̥haspati. The capable, ruddy horses who pull together are pulling Br̥haspati, who is simply strength itself, whose seat has darkness while (the horses) like a cloud clothe themselves in ruddy form. He certainly is flame-bright; he is a preening (bird) with a hundred feathers; having a golden axe, he is vigorous, sun-winning— Br̥haspati—good (for libations) to enter, lofty, the best at making the pressed drink in abundance for his comrades. The two goddesses, the world-halves, begetters of the god, strengthened Br̥haspati with their greatness. Comrades, exert your skill for the one whose skill is to be besought. He will make good fords, easy to cross, for the sacred formulation. Here is a well-twisted (hymn) for you two, o Brahmaṇaspati. A sacred formulation has been made for Indra, the mace-bearer. Aid our insightful thoughts; awaken plentiful gifts. Exhaust the hostilities of the stranger, of the rapacious ones. Br̥haspati and Indra, you two hold sway over heavenly and earthly goods. Establish wealth for your praiser, even a weak one. – Do you protect us always with your blessings."

Once one of them speaks the speech of the other, like a pupil that of his teacher, (then) a whole section of them speaks as if in unison, when you of good speech speak amid the waters. One of them has a cow’s bellow, one a goat’s bleat; one is speckled, one green. Bearing the same name but different forms, they ornament their voice in many ways as they speak. Like brahmins at an “Overnight” soma ritual, speaking around (a soma vessel) full like a pond, you cycle around to that day of the year, which, o frogs, is the one marking the rainy season. The brahmins, having soma, have made speech, creating their yearly sacred formulation. The Adhvaryus, having the hot ritual milk-drink (at the Pravargya ritual), sweating, become visible; none are hidden. They guarded the godly establishment of the twelve(-month); these men do not confound the season. In a year, when the rainy season has come, the heated ritual milk-drinks obtain their own release.

Set forth unrelenting hatred against the hater of the sacred formulation, the eater of raw flesh, the one with a terrible glance—against the worm-eater. Indra and Soma, spear the evil-doers within their hole out into darkness that offers nothing to hold onto, so that no one at all will come up from there again. Let this power of yours, full of battle fury, be for vanquishing. Indra and Soma, make the crushing weapon of death roll from heaven and from earth toward the one who speaks evil. Fashion a reverberating (weapon) up out of the mountains, with which you grind down the demonic force that has been growing strong. Indra and Soma, make it roll from heaven. With fire-heated (weapons) that smite like stones, with unaging (weapons) whose murderous force is searing heat, spear the voracious ones down into a deep place. Let them go to silence. Indra and Soma, let this thought here encircle you on all sides, like a girth-band two prizewinning horses— the thought that, as ritual offering [/invocation], I impel around you, with wisdom (as the goad). Like lords of men, quicken these sacred formulations. Keep (this) in mind! With your thrusting ways smite the deceits of the demon with his wreckage. Indra and Soma, let there be no good passage for the evildoer who with his deceit ever shows hostility against us. Whoever bears witness against me with untruthful words, as I behave with guileless mind, like waters grabbed in a fist, let the speaker of nothing come to nothing, Indra. Those who distort (my) guileless speech in their (usual) ways, or who spoil an auspicious one according to their wont, let Soma give them over to the serpent or set them in the lap of Dissolution. Whoever wishes to cheat us of the essence of food, o Agni, or of our horses, of our cows, of our bodies, let the swindling thief who does the theft go to insignificance. Let him be bent double, along with his life and lineage. Let him be far in the distance, along with his life and lineage; let him be beneath all three earths. Let his glory dry up, o gods—whoever wishes to cheat us by day and whoever by night. Good discrimination is (easy) for the perceptive man: the two (types of) speech, true and untrue, contend with each other. Which of the two is true, whichever is straighter, just that Soma aids— he smites the untrue. Truly, Soma does not promote the crooked man, nor one who sustains his rule perversely. He smites demonic force; he smites one who speaks what is untrue. Both lie in the toils of Indra. If I were a man with false gods, or if I call upon the gods wrongly, o Agni... . Why are you angry at us, Jātavedas? Let those whose speech is deceitful to you attend upon dissolution. Let me die today if I am a sorcerer, or if I have scorched the lifespan of a man. And he should be separated from ten (generations of?) heroes, whoever says falsely to me: “you sorcerer.” Who says to me, who am without sorcery, “you sorcerer,” or who, (though) a demon, says “I am pure,” let Indra smite him with a great weapon of death. Let him fall lowest of all creation. She who goes forth by night like a nightjar [?], concealing her own body by deceit, she should fall down into holes without end. Let the pressing stones smash the demons with their tramplings. Spread out among the clans, Maruts. Seek, grab, crush together the demons— the ones who, having become birds, fly through the nights, or those who have deployed their swindles at the divine ceremony. Roll the stone forth from heaven, Indra; hone the soma-honed one entirely, bounteous one. From in front, from behind, from below, from above, strike at the demons with the mountain. These very dog-sorcerers are flying. Those inclined to deceit desire to deceive Indra, the undeceivable. The able one is honing his weapon of death for the slanderers. Now he discharges the missile toward the sorcerers. Indra has become the one who pounds aside the sorcerers, the oblation-stealers, those who seek to ambush. The able one, splitting them like an axe a tree, breaking them like pots, advances against those who are really demons. The owl-sorcerer, the owlet-sorcerer—smash them, and the dog-sorcerer and the wolf-sorcerer, the eagle-sorcerer and the vulture-sorcerer. As if with a mill-stone, pulverize the demonic power, Indra. Don’t let the demonic power of the sorcerers reach us. Let (Dawn) banish with her dawning the pair that are worm-eaters. Let Earth protect us from earthly constraint; let the Midspace protect us from heavenly (constraint). Indra, smash the male sorcerer and the female exulting in her magic power. Let the no-necks with feckless gods shake to pieces. Let them not look upon the sun as it rises. Look on; look out: Indra and Soma, be vigilant. Hurl the weapon of death at the demonic forces, the missile at the sorcerers."

For even though these peoples now, every man for himself, call upon you for help, let it be our sacred formulation, Indra, that becomes your strengthening now and throughout all days. O bounteous one, the poetic inspirations, those attentive to poetic inspiration—the ones belonging to the stranger (and those belonging) to (our) peoples—keep crisscrossing each other. Hop to! Bring here (to be) nearest a prize of many forms, for help. Not even for a great exchange gift would I hand you over, you possessor of the stone, not for a thousand, not for ten thousand, you possessor of the mace, not for a hundred, you of a hundred rewards. You are better for me, Indra, than a father and than a brother who benefits not. You and a mother seem to me to be alike, o you who are good for goods and largesse. Where have you gone? Where are you? For surely your mind is in many places. Are you on the rise?—you fighter, creator of tumult, cleaver of strongholds. They have sung forth their songs. Chant forth a song to him who cleaves strongholds for his favorite— (it is songs) because of which the mace-wielder will travel to sit upon the ritual grass of Kāṇva and split fortresses. Those of yours which bring ten cows, which bring a hundred, a thousand, those horses of yours which are swift-running bulls, with these come swiftly to us. Today I summon the juice-yielding (cow), pulsing with excitement from the songs, Indra, the good milker, the lead milk-cow, the broad-streamed refreshment, who gets it right. When he gave a push to Etaśa, (the steed) of the Sun, and to the two far-wandering winged (steeds) of the Wind, he of a hundred resolves conveyed Kutsa, the son of Arjuna.

He [=Indra] who, even without a bandage, before (the missile) drills into the collarbones, joins together the join—he, the bounteous one with many goods: he makes what has gone awry right again. May we not be like outsiders, like foreigners to you, Indra. Like trees left behind (by woodcutters), we have considered ourselves poor at burning, you possessor of the stone. Indeed we have considered ourselves neither swift nor strong, you Vr̥tra-smasher. But in an instant, through your great generosity, o champion, we could (again) take delight in your praise. If he will listen to my praise, let our (soma-)drops invigorate Indra, when they have run swift across the filter, they that strengthen the son of Tugra [=Bhujyu]. Come here today to the joint praise from your favorite and comrade. Let the invitatory praise of the bounteous ones help you forward. Then I am eager for good praise for you. Once you (priests) have pressed the soma with the stones, rinse it in the waters. The superior men, garbing (it) in cows [=milk] as if in garments, will milk (it) out from the belly. (Coming) then from earth or then from heaven, from the lofty realm of light, by this my song become strong in your own body. Bring created things to fullness, o you of strong resolve. For Indra press well the most invigorating soma worthy to be chosen. The potent one [=Indra] will swell him who is spurred on, like a prize-seeking (horse), by every insight. I, always begging you with my song—with the gush [?] of soma let me not anger you, frenzied like a wild beast, at the soma-pressings. Who will not beg his master? (Begging) the mighty one with his mighty power for his exhilaration roused by the exhilarating drink, the one triumphant over all when roused to exhilaration—for in his exhilaration he always gives to us. In his treasury are many desirable things. The god (will grant them) to the pious mortal; he will grant to him who presses and to him who praises—(the god) who is welcomed by all, praised by the stranger. Drive here, Indra—find your invigoration (here)—together with your bright bounty, o god. Fill your belly, like a lake, broad and fat with soma juices drunk in common. Here let a thousand, here let a hundred, yoked to a golden chariot— the long-maned fallow bays, yoked by a sacred formulation—convey you to drink the soma, o Indra. Here let the two fallow bays (yoked) to the golden chariot, those with peacock tails and white backs, convey you to drink of the honey, of the strengthening stalk. Drink of this pressed (soma), you who long for songs, like the first drinker [=Vāyu]. This pressed drink of the juicy, thoroughly prepared (soma), cherished for invigoration, acts the lord. He who is unique through his wondrous skill, the great and mighty one is dominant through his commandments. The fair-lipped one will come—he will not stay away, he will come here. He will not avoid our call. You crushed completely the roving fortress of Śuṣṇa with your deadly weapons. You followed the light, (and shall) once again, when, Indra, you will become the one to be summoned. Mine are the praises when the sun has risen, mine at the day’s midday, mine in the evening at the border of night, that have turned you here, o good one. Praise (them)! Just praise (them)! They are the most bounteous of bounty among your bounteous ones: Ninditāśva, Prapathin, and Paramajyā, o Medhyātithi. When with trust in the winning horses I mount on the chariot, of the valuable goods what will stand out is the livestock coming from Yadu. Who has bounteously given two silvery (horses) to me, together with a golden hide, let him be dominant over all auspicious things—Svanadratha, (son of) Āsaṅga. Then Āsaṅga, the son of Playoga, will give more than others, o Agni, by ten thousand. Then for me ten gleaming bullocks emerged, like reeds from a pond. His thick (member) has become visible in front along its length—a boneless thigh hanging down. His woman, ever ready, having caught sight of it, says, “My lord, you’re bringing (me) an excellent treat!”"

He will drink for manly strength— He who among the unwavering is the best at finding the prize that brings horses for the singers, that brings cattle for the praisers. Pressers, rinse the soma that is ever to be admired for the one to be exhilarated, for the hero, the champion. The Vr̥tra-smasher, the drinker of the pressed (soma) will come. Not far from us will he stop, the one with a hundred forms of help. Here, just here will his two capable fallow bays, yoked by the sacred formulation, carry our comrade, famed through songs, longing for songs. The soma juices are sweet: drive here! The soma juices are prepared: drive here— o you with (lovely) lips, accompanied by the seers, possessed of ability—on your own to the landing site, to the joint revelry. The praises that strengthen you for great generosity and manly action, o Indra, strengthening (you) as the decisive victor, And the songs for you, o you whose vehicle is song, and the solemn words—these are for you— those which have in every way deployed their powers. Just so the powerfully ranging one with mace in hand is the only one to distribute the prizes of victory—indestructible from of old. He is the smasher of Vr̥tra with his right (hand)—the many times much-called-upon Indra, the great one with great powers, In whom are all the settled domains and both exploits and expanses. The (soma) invigorating for the bounteous (Indra) (follows) along. He has done these things—Indra, who is famed beyond all things as the giver of prizes to the bounteous (patrons). Even from behind he brings to the fore the cattle-seeking chariot that he helps, for he is the powerful conveyor of goods.

Sacrifice to him, o Priyamedhas, with fully focused mind—to Indra, whose exhilaration becomes real through the soma juices.

This one, created with might by a thousand seers, spreads wide like the sea. (When) realized, his greatness, his vast power is sung at sacrifices in the realm of the inspired poet. It is just Indra for the sake of the divine assemblage, Indra as the ceremony advances, Indra whom we call upon when we are winning at the encounter— Indra, in order to gain the stake. Indra by his greatness spread the two worlds and his vast power; Indra made the sun shine. Within Indra are all beings held and within Indra the pressed drops. To you, for you to drink first, o Indra, with their praises the Āyus and the R̥bhus united sounded together, and the Rudras sang (to you) as the foremost. Indra increased his own bullish vast power in the exhilaration of the pressed (soma) in the company of Viṣṇu. Today the Āyus praise his greatness as in the earlier way. I beg you for a mass of good heroes and for the sacred formulation to be first in your thought. That with which, when the stake was set, (you were there) for the Yatis and for Bhr̥gu, with which you helped Praskaṇva, With which you sent the great waters surging to the sea, that is your bullish vast power, Indra. In a single day that greatness of his cannot be fully attained, toward which the battle-cry has roared. Muster your ability for us, Indra, when I beg you for wealth and a mass of good heroes. Muster your ability for the one striving to first win the prize. Muster your ability for the praise song, foremost one. Muster your ability for us since you helped Paura (and help) the insights of this one striving to win, Indra. Muster your ability just as you furthered Ruśama, Śyāvaka, and Kr̥pa possessing solar glory, Indra. What among the unshakable things should a powerful mortal sing anew? For, (even though) singing the sun, they have not reached his greatness, his Indrian power. Praising what will they be acting according to truth among the gods? Which inspired poet will be lauded as a seer? When will you come to the call of the man who presses, o bounteous Indra, when (to that) of the man who praises? These most honeyed songs and praises rise up— entirely victorious, gaining the stake, possessing imperishable help, competing for the prize like chariots. The Kaṇvas—like the Bhr̥gus, (themselves) like suns—have attained everything conceivable. Magnifying Indra with praises, the Āyus and Priyamedhas sounded. Yoke up your pair of fallow bays, o Indra, best smiter of obstacles, from out of the far distance, (then,) o bounteous one, turned our way, come here, a mighty one with lofty (horses), to drink the soma. For these bards, inspired poets, have bellowed for you for the winning of wisdom with their insight. You, o bounteous Indra longing for songs—like a tracker listen to our call. You kicked Vr̥tra out from the lofty steppes, Indra. You drove (the cows) of Arbuda and the tricky Mr̥gaya out, out the cows of Parvata. The fires shone out, out the sun, out the soma, the Indrian sap. You blew the great serpent out from the midspace: that manly act did you perform, Indra. The one that Indra and the Maruts, that Pākasthāman, the son of Kurayāṇa, gave me— the most beautiful of all in body, like the one that runs in heaven [=sun]— (That) sorrel has Pākasthāman given me, —good at the yoke-pole, filling his girthband, an awakener of wealth, Alongside which the other ten draft-horses draw the yoke-pole home, like birds the son of Tugra. Food is the lifebreath, garments the body, and anointment is the giver of strength. But as the fourth I have proclaimed Pākasthāman, the nurturing giver of the sorrel."

      "text": "When, Indra, you are being called forward or back, up or down, by men, you yourself, propelled by men, are many times in the company of the descendants of Anu, are in the company of Turvaśa, you vaunter. Or when, Indra, in the company of Ruma, Ruśama, Syāvaka, or Kr̥pa, you bring yourself to exhilaration, the Kaṇvas, whose vehicle is praise, guide you here with their sacred formulations, Indra. Come here! As a thirsty buffalo goes down to a salt-pocket made by water, come swiftly here to us in friendship [/in the morning], in the evening. In the company of the Kaṇvas, drink up! Let the drops exhilarate you, bounteous Indra, to give largesse to the presser. Having stolen the pressed soma, you drank it in a cup. (Then) you assumed this most superior might. He put forward his might with might; he shattered battle fury with his power. All who seek battle, vigorous Indra, hold themselves down, like trees, before you. He is accompanied by an ever-battling warrior as if by a thousand— whoever has achieved a praise-invocation for you. He puts his own son forward with a good twist amid an abundance of good heroes—(whoever) ritually serves with words of reverence. Might we not fear, might we not grow weary in comradeship with you, the powerful one. A great deed of you the bull should be witnessed. Might we see Turvaśa and Yadu. The bull wears (it [=the earth]) on his left hip. His giving is not resentful. The milk-cows are infused with the honey of the bees. Come here swiftly! Run! Drink! Your comrade, o Indra, certainly has a horse and chariot, is lovely in form and rich in cows. He is always accompanied by the vigor of a swelling portion. Glittering, he drives to the assembly. Like a thirsting antelope, come to the drinking hole. Drink the soma as you will. Pissing down day after day, o bounteous one, you have assumed the most powerful might. Adhvaryu, make the soma run: Indra wants to drink. Now he has yoked his two bullish fallow bays and has come here, the Vr̥tra-smasher. Even he himself considers himself a pious man at whose place you become sated on soma. Here is your food, ready for yoking, fully sprinkled: of it—come! run!—drink. Adhvaryus, press the soma for Indra who stands on the chariot. The stones gaze out upon (the upper surface) of the coppery (soma) as they press the one belonging to pious ceremonies. His two favorites, the bullish fallow bays, will convey Indra to the coppery (soma) among the industrious (priests). Let your team, the glory of the ceremony, convey you, facing our way, right here to our pressings. We choose Pūṣan of many goods for yoking. You able one, invoked by many, you releaser—do your best because of our insight to thrust out wealth for us. Sharpen us like a razor in your hands. Bestow riches, you releaser. In you is that ruddy good [=cattle] easy to find for us (and for) the mortal whom you urge on. I pursue you, Pūṣan, to aim (toward you). I pursue you to praise (you), glowing one. I do not pursue (anything) of his—for that is alien, o good one, (and it is) for Pajra Sāman to praise. Away (be) the cows toward some (other) pasture, o glowing, immortal one, (to be) our own legacy. Become our kindly helper, Pūṣan, most munificent for the winning of prizes. Substantial is the bounty that brings a hundred horses at Kuruṅga’s rituals of day(break). At the gifts of the vibrant king, bestowing good fortune, we thought ourselves to be among the Turvaśas. Won through the insights of the prizewinning descendant of Kaṇva, (won) by the heaven-bound Priyamedhas, sixty thousand flawless [?] (cows) I drive along, (drive) forth herds of cows—I the seer. Even the trees have found pleasure at my supper-time. They share in the cow in its profusion; they share in the horse in its profusion."

Manfully, o wondrous ones, with your mind-yoked chariot of broad dimensions you accompany Dawn, o Aśvins. O you rich in prizewinning mares, praise songs have appeared facing you two. Like a messenger I shall solemnly proclaim my speech. *O Kaṇvas, for us shall I praise the two dear to many, delightful to many, who bring many good things, the Aśvins—for their help— The most munificent, the best prizewinners, the two lords of beauty bringing refreshments who go to the house of the pious man. To the pious man who has the gods well on his side (give) good wisdom that doesn’t doublecross him; sprinkle his pasture-land with ghee. Here to our praise song drive quickly at speed with your swift falcons, your horses, With which you fly around the three far distances, all the luminous realms of heaven, and the three nights. And refreshments along with cattle and winnings, too, o finders of the days— unfasten the paths for us to win (them). Convey here to us, o Aśvins, wealth in cattle, in good heroes and good chariots, and refreshments along with horses. Having grown strong, o lords of beauty, you wondrous ones whose tracks are golden, drink the somian honey. O you rich in prizewinning mares, to us and to our bounteous (patrons) hold out extensive shelter that cannot be cheated. Team up the formulations of the people and come quickly here. Do not go to the others. You, o Aśvins—drink of this dear exhilarating drink, of the honey bestowed, o holy ones. Bring here to us wealth in hundreds and thousands, consisting of much livestock, nourishing all. Even though in many places men of inspired thought vie with (other) cantors in invoking you two— o men, o Aśvins, come here. The people, provided with twisted ritual grass and oblations, making fit preparations, call upon you two, o Aśvins. Today let this praise song of ours, which best conveys you nearest, be for you two, o Aśvins. The skin-bag of honey that was set here in your chariot-rut, drink from it, o Aśvins. O you rich in prizewinning mares, with it bring weal for our livestock, our offspring, and our cow, and refreshments rich in fat. And heavenly refreshments and rivers, o finders of the days— like two doors, you will open (these) up for us. When did the son of Tugra, abandoned in the sea, do reverence to you, o men, so that your chariot would fly with its birds? O Nāsatyas, to Kaṇva, (his eyes) pasted shut and in a locked house, over and over you offer your help. Drive here with this help, when with our newer good lauds I call upon you, o you with bullish goods. Just as you helped Kaṇva, Priyamedha, Upastuta, Atri, and Śr̥ñjāra, o Aśvins, And just as you (helped) Aṃśu when the stake was to be decided and Agastya when (it was) cows, and Sobhari when (it was) victory-prizes, For so much favor, or more than that, do we singers beg you, o Aśvins with bullish goods. O Aśvins, the chariot with golden chariot-box and golden reins that touches heaven—since you will mount it— Golden your chariot-shaft, golden your chariot-pole and your axle; golden both your wheels— With it [=chariot] come here to us even from afar, o you rich in prize mares, to this good praise of mine. From far away you convey here the many refreshments of the Dāsa, while consuming them, o immortal Aśvins. Drive here to us with brilliance, here with fame, here with wealth, Aśvins, you much-gleaming Nāsatyas. Let your feathered birds [=horses], frothing at the mouth, convey you here to the man who performs the ceremony well. Your chariot pursuing our song—the (chariot) that rolls along, along with its refreshment— its wheel does not ram against it. (Drive here) with your golden chariot, with your horses with speedy forefeet, o Nāsatyas, who spur on insights. You sweeten, as it were, the wakeful wild animal [=soma?], o you of bullish goods. Infuse wealth with refreshment for us. O Aśvins, may you know of my new winnings— how Kaśu, the lord of the Cedi, will give a hundred camels, ten thousand cows. He who (previously) bestowed on me a king’s ten (horses?) of golden appearance— beneath the feet of the lord of the Cedis are (all) the communities, the “hide-tanning” men all around. Let no one go by this path by which these Cedis go, lest another man be lauded as a patron who’s a better giver of abundance."

      "text": "Great Indra, who is like rain-bearing Parjanya in might, has grown strong through the praises of Vatsa. They (are) guiding the offspring of truth [=poem] safely across, when they bring it forward—the conveyors, the inspired poets, by the conveyance of truth. The Kaṇvas—when by their praises they have made Indra the one who assures success to their sacrifice, they are speaking their own familial weapon. To his battle fury the clans and all the communities bend down together, like the rivers to the sea. That might of his flared when Indra rolled up both worlds together like a hide. With his mace of a hundred joints, with the ram, he split apart the head of raging Vr̥tra. These insights (bellow out)—we bellow out—again and again toward (you) at the forefront of the inspired words, (the insights that are) missiles, like the blazing of fire— Since, though they are hidden, the insights blaze forth by themselves— the Kaṇvas (blaze forth)—in a stream of truth. Might we attain to this, Indra: to wealth in cows and horses, and to a sacred formulation to be first in your thought. Because it is just I who have acquired the wisdom of truth from my father, I have been (re)born like the sun. I, like Kaṇva, beautify my songs with an age-old thought— just the one with which Indra acquired his unbridled force. (There are those) who have not praised you, Indra, and seers who have praised you, but grow strong just (by) my (praise), as one well praised. When his battle fury smoked, he, breaking Vr̥tra apart joint by joint, sent the waters to the sea. You, Indra, struck your steadfast mace down upon Śuṣṇa the Dasyu, for you, mighty one, are famed as a bull. Neither the heavens, nor the midspaces will encompass mace-bearing Indra with his might, nor will the earths. The one who lay upon the great waters, standing fast against you, Indra, that one you jabbed down into their footsteps. Who held together in his grasp these two great conjoined worlds, that one, o Indra, you hid with shades of darkness. (There are) those Yatis and those Bhr̥gus who have praised you, Indra— but hear just my call, mighty one. These dappled ones milk out ghee and the milk mixture for you, Indra, they being swollen full of truth in this way. The fecund ones who have made you their infant-by-mouth [=nursling] sur(round you), as the supports (of heaven do) the sun [?]. It is just you, lord of power, that the Kaṇvas have strengthened with their recitation, you that the pressed drops (have strengthened). Just under your leadership, o Indra, master of the stones, is the encomium and the sacrifice worth tussling over. Break out great refreshment for us, like a fortress filled with cattle, Indra, and also offspring and abundance of heroes, And this abundance of swift horses, Indra, which will shine forth here at the forefront among the Nāhuṣa clans. You extend your control over the one whose eye is near to the sun [=Agni? gold?], as if over a cattle-pen. When, Indra, you will be gracious to us, When, indeed, you display your power and rule over the settled peoples, o Indra, great and unbounded in your might, Upon you the clans, offering oblations, call for help, (you who are) of broad expanse through the drops. In a remote place of the mountains and at the conjunction of the rivers the inspired poet was born with insight. From here, from the heights, watchful, he looks down upon the sea, from where, quivering, he stirs. Just after that they see the dawning light of the age-old semen, when it is kindled far beyond heaven. The Kaṇvas all strengthen their thought for you, Indra, and your manliness and your bullishness, most powerful one. Enjoy this good praise of mine, Indra. Promote me, and strengthen my thought. And in seeking a sacred formulation for you, you fully grown mace-bearer, as inspired poets we have fashioned (it) in order to live. The Kaṇvas have roared, like waters going along a slope; their winning thought (has roared) to Indra. Their recitations have increased Indra, like the rivers the sea, (Indra,) the unaging one to whom the battle fury has been conceded. Drive here to us from afar, with your two beloved fallow bays. Drink this pressed soma, Indra. Just you, best smasher of obstacles, do the peoples, when they have twisted their ritual grass, call on for the winning of prizes. After you (roll) both worlds, as the wheel rolls (after) Etaśa; after (you roll) the drops being pressed [/sounding]. Reach exhilaration in the presence of Svarṇara and, o Indra, in the reed-filled (place). Become exhilarated by the thought of Vivasvant. Having grown all the way to heaven, the mace-bearing bull roared again and again, the smasher of obstacles, the best drinker of soma. Because you are the first-born seer, being the only master by your might, o Indra, you keep poking out goods. Up to our pressings and toward your delight, let the hundred straight-backed fallow bays carry you. This earlier insight, swollen full of honey and ghee, have the Kaṇvas increased through their recitation. Of the great ones it is just Indra whom the mortal should choose at the ritual offering, Indra whom the one striving to win (should choose) for his help. The fallow bays, praised by Priyamedha, will convey you near, o much praised one, for soma-drinking. At Tirindira’s I received a hundred and at Parśu’s a thousand as the bounties of the Yāduvas. Three hundred chargers, ten thousand cows did they give to Pajra Sāman. The prominent one has reached up to heaven, giving camels yoked in fours, and by his fame (has reached) the Yāduva people."

In that you have certainly set your attention on your course, you resplendent ones displaying your power, the mountains have bent down. They raise themselves upward with the winds—the bellowing ones whose mother is Pr̥śni. They have milked out swelling refreshment. The Maruts scatter mist; they make the mountains tremble, when they drive their course with the winds, When the mountain peak (holds itself) down for your coursing, and the rivers hold themselves down for your expansion and for your great gusting. You at night we invoke for help, you by day, you when the ceremony is proceeding. Up they rise, bright with ruddy breath, along their courses, bellowing on the back of heaven. They release the rein [/ray] with strength, for the sun to travel its path; they have extended themselves with its radiant beams. This hymn of mine, o Maruts, this praise, o masters of the R̥bhus, this invocation of mine—long for it. Three lakes did the dappled ones milk out as honey for the mace-bearer, a wellspring, a cask full of water. Maruts, when seeking your benevolence we call you from heaven, then come here to us. For—o Rudras, masters of the R̥bhus, possessing good drops—in our house and also in exhilaration you are provident. Wealth, arousing exhilaration, consisting of much livestock, all-nourishing— impel it here to us from heaven, o Maruts. When, as if on (the byways) of the peaks, you have set your attention on your course, resplendent ones, you become exhilarated with the drops being pressed [/sounding]. A mortal might beg benevolence of them, even of such an undeceivable (flock), with his prayers. They who, like droplets, blow their blast through the two world-halves along with their rains, milking the unfailing wellspring, Up they rise with their sounds [/with (the drops) being pressed], up with their chariots, and up with the winds; up with praises—they whose mother is Pr̥śni. With which (aid) you aided Turvaśa and Yadu, with which (you aided) Kaṇva, who gained the stakes, may we receive (a portion) of this for wealth. O you of good drops, these refreshments here swelling like ghee will strengthen you, along with the prayers of the descendant of Kaṇva. Where now do you become exhilarated, you of good drops, you for whom the ritual grass has been twisted? Who is the formulator who serves you? For it is not (now) as it was before, when in return for our praises of you you used to animate the troops of truth, o you for whom the ritual grass has been twisted. They put together the great waters, together the two “opponents” [=heaven and earth], together the sun, together the mace, joint by joint. They drove Vr̥tra apart, joint by joint, apart the mountains lacking rules [/radiance], performing a bullish manly deed. They stood by the unbridled force and the resolve of Trita, while he was fighting, (stood) by Indra at the overcoming of Vr̥tra. With lightning in their hands, heaven-bound—golden (helmet-)lips (stretched out) on their head— the resplendent ones anointed themselves for beauty. When you drove with Uśanā from afar to the “loins of the ox” [=Vala cave?], like heaven it [=cave] roared with fear. (Come) here to us, for the giving of bounty, with horses whose forefeet are golden— come near, o gods. When the chestnut side-horse guides the dappled (mares yoked) to their chariot, the resplendent ones drive; they let flow the waters. In (a place) of good soma, reed-filled, foamy, providing (soma’s) dwelling, the men drove in (their chariot) with down-turned wheels. When will you come, o Maruts, to the inspired poet invoking (you) in just this way, (come) with merciful (aid) to the one needing assistance? What is this now, you fair-weather friends?!—since you have deserted Indra, who vaunts himself on partnership with you? O Kaṇvas, for us I will praise Agni along with the Maruts, who have maces in their hands, who have golden axes. I (would turn) hither the bulls, worshiped first at the sacrifice, hither for newer good progress, would turn them who bring glittering prizes. Even the peaks bend down, thinking themselves depths; even the mountains hold themselves down. Traveling crosswise the birds guide (the Maruts) here, as they [=Maruts] fly through the midspace. (The Maruts) establish vital energy for their praiser. Since age-old Agni has (just) been born, like a metrical verse, with the ray of the sun, they [=Maruts] have extended themselves with its radiant beams."

That with which (you helped) Daśagva and Adhrigu possessing solar glory, who sets atremble, with which you helped the sea—for that we beg. (That) by which you impel the great waters forth to the Sindhu like chariots to travel the path of truth—for that we beg. This praise song for dominance, purified like ghee, o master of the stones, by which now in a single day with might you have waxed strong— This one enjoy, o you who yearn for songs—it swells like the sea. O Indra, with all your forms of help you have waxed strong. The god from afar who has become ready for partnership with us— spreading like the one who spreads the rain from heaven [=Parjanya], you have waxed strong. His beacons waxed strong and the mace in his two hands, when, like the sun, he made the two worlds grow. When, o full-grown master of settlements, you devoured a thousand buffaloes, just after that your great Indrian power grew forth. With the rays of the sun Indra burns down Arśasāna; victorious like fire over the woods, he grew forth. This newer visionary thought goes to you, conforming to her season [/to the ritual sequence]. Rendering service, dear to many—she is (well-)measured indeed. As embryo of the sacrifice, seeking the gods, (the thought?) purifies its intention following the proper order. By praises of Indra it has grown—it is (well-)measured indeed. Indra, who is the gain from our alliance, spreads himself out for soma-drinking. (The thought) advancing like an axe for the presser—it is (well-) measured indeed. Whom [=Indra] the inspired Āyus, whose conveyance is solemn speech, have brought to exhilaration— like ghee, it swells in his mouth—(the speech) that belongs to truth. And Aditi gave birth to the praise song for Indra, the sovereign king, (the song) proclaimed by many for his help—(the song) that belongs to truth. The draft-horses have roared to (him) for help and for his glorification. Your two fallow bays, o god, do not follow a commandment separate (from the one) that belongs to truth. When (you drink) soma in company with Viṣṇu or when with Trita Āptya, or when in company with the Maruts you reach exhilaration with the drops— Or when, able one, you reach exhilaration at a distance, upon the sea, take pleasure just in our pressing with its drops— Or when you are the strengthener of the presser, of the sacrificer, o lord of settlements, or in whose solemn speech you take pleasure—together with the drops. Upon hymning the god time after time, for (him) to help you, upon hymning Indra time after time, then they came through to victory for the sacrifice. With sacrifices (they strengthened) him whose vehicle is the sacrifice, with soma-drinks the best soma-drinker; with libations they strengthened Indra—they came through. Great is his guidance and many are the encomia for him. All good things are for the pious man—they came through. Indra did the gods set in front to smash Vr̥tra. To Indra did their voices roar—entirely for his might. To him, great through his greatness, to him hearing the summons through our praise songs and chants do we keep roaring—entirely for his might. The mace-bearer whom the two worlds do not encompass, nor the midspaces, just from his own onslaught he has flared up—entirely from his might. When, o Indra, at the battle-charge the gods set you in front, just after that your two beloved fallow bays waxed strong. When, o mace-bearer, with your vast power you smashed Vr̥tra who was blocking the rivers, just after that your two beloved fallow bays waxed strong. When Viṣṇu strode his three steps by your might, just after that your two beloved fallow bays waxed strong. When your two beloved fallow bays grew strong from day to day, just after that all these worlds held themselves in submission to you. When the Marutian clans held themselves down for you, just after that all these worlds held themselves in submission to you. When you fixed yonder sun, the blazing light, fast in heaven, just after that all these worlds held themselves in submission to you. The inspired poet, through his insights, raises this good praise to you, Indra, which guides its kin safely across, like footsteps, while the ceremony is pro(ceeding). When they have sounded in unison in his own dear domain, in the navel of the sacrifice, along with the milking, while the ceremony is pro(ceeding), Indra, give to us the possession of good heroes, of good horses, of good cows, like a Hotar, (for us) to be first in your thought, while the ceremony is pro(ceeding)."

In the first highest heaven, in the seat of the gods, he is the strengthening one, affording good passage, foremost in fame, entirely victorious amid the waters. I call on him, on Indra the tempestuous, for the winning of prizes, for plunder. Become, for us in your favor, our closest comrade, for strengthening. This gift here, o Indra who yearns for songs, streams for you from the one who presses. Becoming exhilarated, you rule over this ritual grass. Now, o Indra, give us that which we pressers beg of you. Bring here to us the shimmering wealth that finds the sun. When the boundless praiser makes bold his songs for you, your *vitality grows afterward as branches do, when they take pleasure. As of old, I will give birth to the songs: hear the call of the singer. At every revel you have waxed strong for the one who performs (rituals) well. Like waters going along a downward slope, they play—the liberal gifts of him who is called the lord of heaven by this visionary thought. And who is called lord of the separate peoples—he alone exerts his will— by those strengthening (him) through reverence, seeking help. Rejoice in the pressed (soma). Praise the famous one who is attentive to poetic inspiration, to whom belong the two overpowering fallow bays that go to the house of the pious and reverential man. You of great thought, ramming through with your horses frothing at the mouth, with the swift ones, drive here to the sacrifice—for it is surely weal for you. O Indra, most powerful lord of settlements, fix wealth fast in the singers, and immortal fame and goods for our patrons. I call upon you when the sun has risen; I call upon (you) at the day’s midday. Rejoicing, Indra, come here to us with your teams. Come here! Run forth! Take the exhilaration of the pressed (soma) accompanied by cows. Stretch the ancient thread in the way that is known. Whether, able one, you are in the far distance, whether nearby, Vr̥tra-smiter, or whether at the sea of the stalk, it is just you who are our helper. Let our songs increase Indra, let our pressed drops (increase) Indra; in Indra have the oblation-bearing clans found joy. Just him did the inspired poets, seeking aid, (increase) with downward coursing help. The battle cries made Indra increase, as tree-branches do. The gods stretched for themselves a noteworthy sacrifice among the Trikadrukas. Just him [=Indra] let our hymns increase—him who ever increases. When the praiser, following his own commandment, has set out his recitations for you in proper sequence, he is called gleaming, pure, and unerring. He perceives just that youthful (troop) of Rudra [=Maruts] in the ancient domains, where the discerning ones [=Maruts?] have distributed that thought. If you will choose my companionship, drink of this stalk, by which we have crossed beyond all hatreds. O Indra who longs for songs, when will your praiser become most wealful for you? When will you place us amid bovine and equine goods? And your two well-praised bullish fallow bays pull your chariot to (the soma) most exhilarating to (you) who do not age—for whom we beg. For him do we beg, him praised by many, the youthful one with his ancient forms of help. He will sit down upon the dear ritual grass once again. Become increased, o you who are praised by many, with your forms of help that are praised by the seers. Milk out swelling refreshment, and help us. O Indra, it is only you who are the helper of him who praises just so, o master of the stones. From out of the truth I raise to you my insight yoked by mind. Yoking here your two feasting companions, for soma-drinking, cry out to the fallow bays that bring the “forth to that” wealth, Indra. Let them cry out—those who are yours: the Rudras accompany your splendor, as do the clans of Maruts, to your satisfaction. These (clans), his advance (troops), find pleasure in the track that is in heaven. In the navel of the sacrifice they have joined together, as is (well-) known. This one—to take the long view while the rite is going forth toward the east— measures the sacrifice in proper order, having surveyed it. A bull is this chariot of yours, Indra, and your fallow bays are also bulls. A bull are you, o you of a hundred resolves, and our call is a bull. A bull is the pressing stone, a bull the exhilarating drink, and a bull this pressed soma here. A bull is the sacrifice that you urge onward, and our call is a bull. As a bull, I call upon you, the bull, o mace-bearer, together with your brilliant help, for you cherish a responsive praise, and our call is a bull."

Your liberal spirit is a milk-cow for the sacrificer, for the presser: swelling, she gives the cow and horse as her milk. There exists no one to obstruct your generosity, Indra, neither god nor mortal, when, praised, you want to give bounty. The sacrifice made Indra strong, when he unrolled the earth, creating for himself a headdress in heaven. You who have grown strong and won all the stakes— we choose your help, Indra. In the exhilaration of soma he spread out the midspace and the luminous realms— Indra did, when he split Vala. He drove up the cattle for the Aṅgirases, making visible those that were hidden. He shoved Vala nearby. Through Indra the luminous realms of heaven are firm and made firm, stable and not to be shoved aside. Like the waters’ wave that brings exhilaration, the praise song hastens rapidly (to you), Indra. The exhilarating drinks have shone forth for you. For you are the strengthener of praise songs, Indra, the strengthener of recitations, and the creator of good fortune for your praisers. Just Indra will the hairy(-maned) fallow bays carry for the soma-drinking right up to the sacrifice—him who is very generous.

With your (chariots) whose wheel-rims are firm, with your very bright lights—o Maruts, masters of the R̥bhus, o Rudras— with refreshment come here to us today, here to the sacrifice, seeking the Sobharis, o you who are craved by many. For we know the mighty forcefulness of the Rudrian Maruts, the strenuous ones, of quick Viṣṇu, of the ones who grant rewards. The islands keep flying further apart; misfortune stands still; they [=Maruts] yoke both world-halves. The wasteplaces rise forth, when you stir (them), o you self-radiant ones with beautiful bangles. (When you stir) even the unshakeable things on your drive, the mountains and the lord of the forest keep resounding. The earth trembles at your journeys. To allow your onslaught to drive by, o Maruts, heaven raises itself higher aloft, when the men, strong in arm, keep putting their energies on display on their own bodies. According to their nature, following their beauty, the men—greatly vibrant, impetuous, bullish in breath, unobstructed in breath—drive themselves. The music of the Sobharis is anointed with cows. Onto the chariot, into the golden (chariot) cask (come) those well-born (Maruts), akin to a cow [=Pr̥śni], (for us) to enjoy nourishment; the great ones (come here) now for us to gain. O you who rain unguents, present oblations to your own bullish Marutian troop whose leader is a bull [=Indra]. O Maruts, with your chariot with its bullish horses, bullish breath, bullish wheel-naves, come here at will, like winged falcons, to pursue our oblations, o men. Common to them (all) is their unguent; their brilliants glint on their arms. Their spears keep flashing. These mighty bulls with mighty arms do not arrange (such things just) on their bodies: taut bows and weapons are on your chariots, beauties on your faces. Of them whose name is vibrant and widespread like a flood, there is just one (name) for each and every one of them to enjoy. Their might is like the life force of their fathers. Extol these Maruts; praise them. For of these boisterous ones, as of wheel-spokes, there is no last one. This is so as to their giving; as to their greatness is this so. Very fortunate is he who was amid your forms of help at earlier dawnings, o Maruts, or who will be also now. Or the prize-seeker whose oblations you come here to pursue, o men. He will attain to your favors, you shakers, along with brilliant things and the winning of prizes. Just as they wish, so shall it be—they, the sons of Rudra, lord of heaven, the ritual adepts, the youths, The Maruts of good drops who deserve (the soma-drink) and who go about practicing generosity all together. With a better heart even than this [=usual generosity], o youths, turn yourselves hither toward us. To the youths, to the bulls, the pure ones, sing with your newest hymn, o Sobhari, like a plowman to his cows [/celebrating (the Maruts) like cows]. Those who are victorious like a fist-fighter, to be invoked in all contests, among (all) Hotars, those, like lustrous bulls, receiving the most praises—extol them with a hymn: the Maruts, yes! Cows also, likewise akin through common birth, o Maruts of equal spirit, lick each other’s humps. The mortal also will draw near to brotherhood with you, you dancers with brilliants on your breasts. Take note of us, Maruts, for your firmly founded friendship exists always. O Maruts of good drops, convey here to us (some) of your Marut medicine, you comrades in the span. Those with which you aid the Sindhu, with which you triumph, with which you favor Krivi, with those kindly forms of help be a joy to us, you who are joy itself, you who do not partner hatred. O Maruts possessing good ritual grass—what medicine is in the Sindhu, what in the Asiknī, what in the seas, what in the mountains, Seeing it, you carry it all on your bodies. With it intercede for us. To ground (should go) the malady of the afflicted; make what has gone awry right again."

That powerful youth of ours—in his daring—strode right up to you for help in action, for it is just you that we, your comrades, have chosen as the helper who brings gain, o Indra. Drive here. Here are the drops, o lord of horses, lord of cows, lord of fields. Drink the soma, soma-lord. Because we inspired poets without (such) kin hold fast to you who have (those [=horses, etc.] as kin, o Indra, come here with all of them, which are your deposits, to drink the soma, o bull. Like birds (in a tree), sitting by your exhilarating, strengthening honey prepared with cows, we keep bellowing to you, o Indra. When we address you with this homage, will you hesitate even for a moment? Here are desires, and you are the giver, o possessor of the fallow bays. Here are we; here are our visions. Only recently have we come together with your help, Indra, for previously, o master of the stones, we have not known your abundance. We (now) know your comradeship and sustenance, o champion. We beg these of you, o wielder of the mace. And so make us sharp, good one, whenever a prize of cattle is (at stake), o you of beautiful lips. Who previously led us to this better state right here, him shall I praise on your behalf, o comrades, for his help—Indra, Possessor of the fallow bays, lord of settlements, conquering territories. Because as ever it is he who has reached exhilaration, the bounteous one will pursue for us, his praisers, a hundred in cattle and horses. Surely with you as our yokemate, o bull, we could talk back to the snorter at the concourse of the people possessing cattle. As decisive actors, we could be victorious in the decisive action, o much-invoked one; we could stand up to those of evil vision. With our superior men we could smash the obstacle [/Vr̥tra] and swell with strength. O Indra, you have pursued our visions. You are without rival, but by the same token, without friend, Indra, by birth and from of old. Only in battle do you seek friendship. You never take on a rich man for companionship. The booze-fueled revile you. When you make your roar, you just shove (them all) together. It is because of that that you are called on like a father. When we are in companionship with one such as you, Indra, let us not, like foolish (spinsters) who grow old at home, (just) sit still when (the soma) has been pressed. Let us not miss out on your largesse, you whose gift is cattle. Indra, let us not complain about you. Seize hold of even the firmly fixed (goods) of the stranger and bring them here. Those who receive your gifts are not to be swindled. Is it Indra (who gives) so great a bounty, or well-portioned Sarasvatī who gives the goods? Or is it you, o Citra, (who give) to the pious man? Citra is the only king; the other petty little ones who (live) along the Sarasvatī are only kinglets— for like Parjanya with rain, he will thunder [/stretch forth] as he gives a thousand ten thousands."

These two gods who most often appear in many places, the Aśvins— with our acts of reverence may we bring them here nearby for help: they go to the house of the pious man. One wheel of your chariot speeds around; the other, (though) at rest, drives you onward. Let your favor run to us here, like a cow (to its calf), o lords of beauty. Your chariot with its three chariot-boxes and golden reins, o Aśvins, the famous one that busily circles around heaven and earth—with that, come here, o Nāsatyas. Rendering service to Manu, early in the day you plow barley with a wolf. O Aśvins, lords of beauty, today we would praise you together with your favors. O you whose goods are prizewinning mares, drive right up to us along the paths of truth, along which you spur Tr̥kṣi, son of Trasadasyu, for great sovereignty, o bulls.

Don’t look over and beyond us to a cheating mortal, o Rudras whose goods are prizewinning mares. In the early morning I call their easily moving (chariot) to move easily here, or (rather I call) the overpowering Aśvins along with their chariot— I, Śobharī, like a father. With (your chariot) swift as thought, o bulls roused to exuberance, with your forms of help that come quickly, even from far away come to be here for our help with your many (forms of help), you who bring many benefits. O Aśvins, you superior men who are first to drink the honey, to us here drive your course providing horses, cattle, and gold, o wondrous ones. An abundance of good heroes, of good standing and well in advance, desirable, unassailable by the demonic, and all things of value might we acquire at this journey of yours, o you whose goods are prize mares."

And I shall praise the competitors [=flames], (drivers) of chariots, Whose onward thrust, worthy of verses, (aims) to seize refreshments and nourishments. By close searching the driver [=Agni] finds the goods. His flame has stood up and outward, the unaging flame of the shining one, of the very bright one of scorching fang, the glory of a warrior band. Stand up with your divine body while you are being praised, o you who conduct good ceremonies, with your gaze (on us), blazing with your lofty radiance. O Agni, drive (to the gods) with our good lauds, pouring oblations in yourself in the proper sequence, as you have become our oblation-carrying messenger. I call upon Agni on your behalf, the foremost Hotar of the settled domains. I shall hymn him with this speech, and I shall praise him for you all, Him of unerring will, whom, together with his body, they sweeten with their sacrifices, him, like an ally, well established among the people who abide in truth. O you (people) who seek truth—in him abiding in truth, bringing success to the sacrifice with our hymn, in him do they [=the gods] take pleasure, in the footprint of our homage. Let our sacrifices come in unbroken sequence here to the best of the Aṅgirases, who is the most glorious Hotar here among the clans. O unaging Agni, these (flames) of yours, being kindled as lofty light, are displaying their power like bullish horses. O lord of nourishments, give us wealth with an abundance of heroes. Further us in combats when progeny and posterity are at stake. When the clanlord, whetted, is well pleased in the clan of Manu, Agni repels all demonic powers. O Agni, in harkening to my new praise song, you clanlord and hero, with your searing heat burn down the wily demons. Not by any wile should a cheating mortal be master of him who offers ritual service to Agni with gifts of oblations. The seer Vyaśva, seeking bulls [/Ukṣan (=his patron)], pleased you, the finder of goods. For great wealth might we kindle you. Uśanā Kāvya set you down as Hotar— you to win (goods) by sacrifice for Manu as Jātavedas. Because all the gods, altogether, made you their messenger, by harkening (to them), o god, you became the first one worthy of the sacrifice. This same immortal should the mortal, the hero, make his messenger— the pure one of extensive power whose course is black. With ladles extended, we would call upon him of good radiance and blazing flame, the unaging and ancient Agni, to be invoked by the clans. The mortal who has dedicated a poured offering with gifts of oblations to him receives abundant prosperity and glory in heroes. (It goes) first toward Agni Jātavedas, foremost at the sacrifices— the ladle full of the oblation goes with homage. Like Vyaśva, we would do honor to Agni with these most distinguished (thoughts), to him of blazing flame with most munificent thoughts. Now chant to him of extensive power with praise songs like sturdy posts [/like Sthūrayūpa], o seer, son of Vyaśva—to the Agni of the household. Him, the guest of the descendants of Manu, the son of the forest-lords [=trees], ancient Agni do the inspired priests reverently invoke for help. Because he, the great one, is superior to all, (let) the oblations of the descendants of Manu (also be) superior. O Agni, sit down on the ritual grass with homage. Win for us many desirable things. Win of the wealth eagerly sought by many— accompanied by good heroes, offspring, and glory. O Agni, give the impetus to generosity to Varo Suṣāman and to his people, each and every one, always—o youngest good one. For you are the furtherer. Uncover for us refreshments consisting of cows and the winning of great wealth, o Agni. Agni, you are glorious. Convey Mitra and Varuṇa here, the sovereign kings possessing the truth and of refined skill."

Being praised, bring here to us wealth that offers most brilliant fame— you who are exclusively the good giver, o master of the fallow bays. Tear out what is exclusive and dear to the peoples, Indra. Being praised, bring it here boldly, bold one. Hindrances obstruct neither your left nor your right hand, nor do repulsions, o master of the fallow bays, in your quests for cattle.

O Vr̥tra-smasher, o champion, might we know of this newer, eagerly sought generosity of yours, o good one, much-invoked. For, Indra, just as for you there exists a swelling might that cannot be encompassed, o dancer, your giving to the pious man cannot be impaired, o much-invoked one. Rain yourself down, o you who are greater than great, o best of men, for great generosity. Being yourself steadfast, stand fast, bounteous one, for bounteous giving. Never have our hopes gone to any other place than you, o master of the stones. Bounteous one, exert your ability for us with your help. For surely I do not find any other than you, for generosity, o dancer, for wealth, for brilliance, and for swelling might, o you who long for songs. Pour here the drop for Indra: he will drink the somian honey. He will spur himself on in his generosity and greatness. I have addressed the lord of the fallow bays as he engorges his skill. Now listen to the son of Aśva as he praises. For surely never before has a greater hero than you been born, neither in wealth—not in just such a way (as you are)—nor in favor. (Pour) right here what is more invigorating than honey, or pour, Adhvaryu, (what is more invigorating) than the stalk, for in this way the ever-strengthening hero is praised. O Indra, mounter of the fallow bays, none has reached up to your foremost praise hymn in swelling strength nor in favor. Seeking fame, we have called upon the lord of prizes on your behalf, (comrades,) upon him who is to be strengthened by unremitting sacrifices. Come now! Comrades, let us praise Indra, the superior man worthy of praise, who all alone surmounts all the separate peoples. For the heaven-ruling one who does not withhold cattle, who seeks cattle, speak a wondrous speech, sweeter than ghee and honey, For him whose heroic deeds are immeasurable, whose generosity is not to be circumscribed, whose priestly gift surmounts everything, like light. Like Vyaśva, praise Indra, who controls the prizewinning (horse) that rides the wave, liberally apportioning the property of the stranger to the pious man. In just this way now, o Vaiyaśva, praise him anew [/to the nines, and then] a tenth time— the one who knows well, worthy to be celebrated by those who roam. For you know how to avoid calamities day after day, o you with mace in hand, as a preener [=water bird] does snares. Bring that help here, Indra, with which, o most wondrous one, (you are there) for the (ritually) active man. Once again pierce (Śuṣṇa?) for Kutsa and force (him) down. We beg you now for a new (life?) for an older (man), o most wondrous one. You are victorious over all our antagonists— (You, the one) who releases (us) from the bear and from constraint or who (releases constraint) from the Ārya amid the seven rivers. You have made the Dāsa’s weapon bow, o you of powerful manliness. Just as you conveyed wealth to Varo Suṣāman for his gain and to the Vyaśvas, o well-portioned (Dawn) rich in prizewinning mares, (Even so) let the priestly gift of Nārya come to the Vyaśvas, who provide soma, as well as substantial generosity in hundreds and thousands. When the sacrificer will ask you: “Where (is he), you where-actor?” (you will answer:) “This ‘Vala’ [=the patron Varo Suṣāman], who is set apart, is descending toward the Gomatī (River) [/pen full of cows].”"

Their mother, great truth-possessing Aditi, gave birth to the two who possess all possessions, whose greatness (goes) forward to lordship. Great Mitra and Varuṇa, sovereign kings, gods and lords [/devas and asuras], truth-possessing, loudly sound their lofty truth. The two grandsons of great strength, the sons of skill, strong-willed, possessing fat drops, dwell in the house of refreshment. You two who control the drops, the earthly and heavenly refreshments— let your cloud-accompanied rains drift here. The two who from lofty heaven look down upon (us) as if upon your herds, the truth-possessing ones were installed as sovereign kings for reverence. Truth-possessing, strong-willed, the two took their place for sovereign kingship. Their commandments upheld, the rulers attained their rule. Better even than the eye at finding the way, by means of eyesight without motes, even when blinking, the two attentive ones remain attentive. And let the goddess Aditi, let the two Nāsatyas [=Aśvins] give us room; let the Maruts, whose strength has increased, give room. You (all) of good drops—give room to our roar by day and by night. Not suffering harm, might we be accompanied by protectors. Not suffering harm, we (sing) to Viṣṇu of good drops who does not smite. Listen, o River traveling your own course, (for us) to be first in your thought. We choose what is worth choosing, the best choice, worthy of protection, which Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman protect. And that (let) the River among the waters (grant) to us, that (grant) the Maruts, that the Aśvins, and Indra and Viṣṇu—the generous ones of one accord. For these superior men strike against the hostility of any zealot, like roiling (rivers) their sharp surge. This (Sun) here, as clanlord, gazes widely—the one (gazing) over the many. We proceed according to his commandments and yours [=Ādityas’]. We follow the ancient accustomed ways of the one [=the Sun] associated with the sovereign kings [=Ādityas], the long-heard commandments of Mitra and of Varuṇa. He who measured on every side the ends of heaven and of earth with his ray, he filled both world-halves with his greatness. This Sun held up his light under the shelter of heaven, blazing like fire when it has been kindled and bepoured. The speech at (the place) providing a long seat [=ritual ground] gains control over a prize rich in cattle; it gains control over non-poisonous food for giving. I speak this to the Sun and to both world-halves, at evening and at dawn: “Always rise up to us among our benefactors.” A silvery (horse) at Ukṣaṇyāyana’s (sacrifice), a silver one at Harayāṇa’s, and a yoked chariot at Suṣāman’s—these have we gained. These two are overflowing with (bounties) of horses, with fallow bays, for me; and the two (horses) that carry men (are overflowing) with those that get results. With my newest inspired thought I have gained two altogether, along with their reins and with their whips, two chargers great at the winning of prizes."

He furthers his dwelling place, ex(tends) his great refreshments, who does ritual service to your liking. He is propagated through progeny forth from his foundation. Unharmed and whole, he thrives. That one acquires without fighting; along (paths) easy to go on he travels his routes, whom Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman protect—they of like generosity and like delight. Even in the flat plain you make a niche for him; even in difficult going (you make for him) smooth flowing. Also this missile—it is now far from him—let it go unfaltering to destruction. Since today as the sun was rising you established truth, o you of dear dominion, since at (sun)set, at awakening, or since at midday of the day, you affording all possessions, Or since at evening, o lords, you held out shelter to the pious man who pursues truth, so might we stay nearby you, you good ones affording all possessions, in your midst. Since today when the sun rose, since at midday, since at the (time of) covering [=evening?], you establish a thing of value for Manu the discerning oblator, o you affording all possessions, We would choose this much-protecting (shelter) of yours, o sovereign kings, as a son would (his father’s shelter).

No one can restrain his powers, his liberalities; no one can say, “he does not give.” There exists no debt to the formulators, nor to the puffed-up pressers now: no soma has been drunk without a counter(gift). Sing just to the admirable one, to the admirable one recite solemn words; perform sacred formulations just for the admirable one.

With snow [/an icicle?] he pierced Arbuda.

Every kind of vigor does Agni acquire, even as (soon as) he longs for it—his oblation is the nourishment of the good ones— he acquires luck and lifetime, acquires joy, for every invocation of the gods. – Let all the other squirts burst!

He is decked out with gift-cows, and he impels (them) to the (gift-) reception. – Let all the other squirts burst! Agni knows the races of the gods, Agni (those) of mortals: (this is his) secret name [=Jātavedas]. Agni is the giver of treasure. Agni opens the doors, when well bepoured with a newer (speech). – Let all the other squirts burst! Agni is joined with goods among the gods, among the clans devoted to sacrifice. With delight he fosters the many poetic arts, as the earth (fosters) everything—the god devoted to sacrifice among the gods. – Let all the other squirts burst! Agni, who, belonging to the seven human (divisions), is fixed amid all the rivers— to him have we come—the one with three dwellings, the best smasher of Dasyus for Mandhātar, Agni foremost in the sacrifices. – Let all the other squirts burst! Agni inhabits the three (cosmic) divisions with their three parts, as sage poet. He will sacrifice to the thrice eleven (gods) here and please them for us, as inspired poet and messenger, when he has been prepared. –Let all the other squirts burst! You, foremost Agni, among the Āyus, among the gods, alone have control over goods for us. Around you do the swirling waters circle, which are their own bridges. – Let all the other squirts burst!"

For you right here, yearning for it, o unbounded Jātavedas, o Agni, I generate a lovely praise hymn. Like brilliants, certainly, are your sharp scintillations, Agni. With their teeth they snap at the woods. The fallow bays with smoke as their beacon, sped by the wind up toward heaven, take up opposing positions—the fires. These fires kindled here in opposing (places) have come to sight all at once, like the beacons of the dawns. Black are the realms at the feet of Jātavedas on his advance, when Agni grows on the earth. Making the plants his wellspring (of nourishment), snapping (at them), Agni does not become extinguished, as he comes once again to the tender ones. Bending back and forth with his tongues, flickering here and there with his flame, Agni shines brightly in the woods. In the waters is your seat, Agni. You grow through the plants. While (still) being in their womb, you are born again. This flame of yours, Agni, when bepoured, blazes up from the ghee, kissing the offering spoons on the mouth. To him whose food is oxen, whose food is barren cows, to the ritual adept with soma on his back— to Agni we would do honor with praises. And you, o Hotar whose resolve is worthy to be chosen, with homage and with kindling sticks do we beseech, o Agni. And you, o Agni blazing when bepoured, like Bhr̥gu, like Manu, like Aṅgiras, do we invoke. For you—o Fire by fire, a poet by a poet, the real (thing) by a real (man), a comrade by a comrade—are kindled. You—to the pious poet grant wealth in thousands, o Agni, and refreshment abounding in heroes. O Brother Agni, made by might, having ruddy horses, of blazing commandment— enjoy this praise of mine. And you, Agni, have my praises reached—(the praises generated) for the bellowing one who yearns for (them)— like cows their cow-stall. For you, best of the Aṅgirases, all these lovely settlements have separately yielded themselves to your desire, Agni. With their insightful thoughts the inspired wise ones who are attentive to poetic inspiration have spurred Agni to join their meal. You, Agni, prizewinner on the drives, do those who stretch out their ceremony reverently invoke as draft-horse (of the sacrifice), as Hotar. Because you are of the same aspect in many places, preeminent throughout all the clans, in combats we call upon you. Reverently invoke him, Agni who flashes forth when bepoured with (streams of) ghee. He will listen to this call of ours. It is you we call upon, the listening Jātavedas, who smash away hatreds, o Agni. The infallible ruler of the clans, this overseer here of the (ritual) statutes— Agni do I reverently invoke: he will listen. Agni pulsing with excitement all his life—like a young blood spurred on to seek the prize, like a (prize-seeking) team do we incite him. Smashing away insults and hatreds, burning demonic forces everywhere, Agni, shine with your sharp (flame). You whom the peoples kindle, as Manu did, o best of the Aṅgirases, Agni, take cognizance of my speech. O might-made Agni, whether you are born in heaven or born in the waters, we call upon you with hymns. To you do these peoples here, all the lovely settlements separately, impel the wellspring (of nourishment) to be eaten. O Agni, may we be very attentive and with manly gaze, crossing over difficult depths through all the days. Agni, the gladdening one dear to many, sharp, pure-flamed, do we implore with gladdening hearts. You, Agni, with far-radiant goods, dispatching (darkness) like the sun with its rays, vaunting yourself, you keep smashing the dark shades. This we implore of you, mighty one—that your giving does not give out. From you, Agni, (comes) the good thing worthy to be chosen."

I call the child of nourishment, pure-flamed Agni, here to this sacrifice of good ceremony. You who have the might of Mitra, o Agni, with your flaming flame sit here on our ritual grass along with the gods. The mortal who serves god Agni in his own house, just for that man will he bring goods to light. Agni is the head, the peak of heaven; this (Agni) here is lord of the earth. He quickens the spawn of the waters. Your flaming flames rise up as they flash, Agni, your lights, your beams. Because you hold sway over a choice gift, Agni, as lord of the sun, might I, your praiser, be in your shelter. You, Agni, do those of inspired thought, you do they spur on with their insights. Let our hymns strengthen you. Of the undeceivable, self-empowered messenger who is always crackling— of Agni would we choose the comradeship. Agni, best possessor of flaming commandments, flaming inspired poet, flaming sage poet, flaming he shines when he is bepoured. And let my visionary thoughts, let my hymns strengthen you at all times. Agni, take cognizance of our comradeship. If I were you, Agni, or you were me, your hopes would come true here. Because you are surely the good lord of goods, Agni, with far-radiant goods, may we be in your benevolence. Agni, like rivers to the sea, to you of steadfast commandments do our hymns go bellowing. The youthful clanlord, the sage poet, omnivorous, pulsing with much excitement— Agni do I beautify with my thoughts. To the charioteer of the sacrifices, sharp-fanged, staunch, would we make haste with praises—to Agni. Let this singer here abide in you, comrade Agni. To him be merciful, o pure one. For you are a clever companion at table, always wakeful like an inspired poet. Agni, you will give light (all the way up) to heaven. Agni, in the face of difficult passages, in the face of insults, o sage poet, lengthen our lifetime, o good one."

Unembattled himself, in battle the champion drives the troop along with his warriors, of whom Indra is the youthful comrade. The Vr̥tra-smiter took the Bunda-bow; just born, he asked his mother: “Which ones are powerful; which ones are famed?” She, the strong one [/Śavasī], replied to you: “Like a wasp at a mountain he will fight, who desires rivalry with you.” And you, o bounteous one—listen: “Who wishes (something) of you, for that you exert your will. What you will make firm, that is firm.” When the setter of contests drives to the contest in search of good horses, Indra is the best charioteer of charioteers. Rip apart all attackers, mace-bearer, as if into (a million) pieces. Become the one who most receives our praises. Let Indra set our chariot in front to win, he whom injuries do not injure. May we avoid your hatred (and be) fit for you to give to, able one. May we go to (prizes) consisting of cattle, Indra— O possessor of the (pressing) stone, (the soma drops), though they move deliberately, are bringing horses and hundreds of cattle, are strengthening and faultless. For day after day your upright liberal spirit is ready to give thousands, hundreds to the singers. For we know you as winner of spoils, Indra, bursting even into the fastnesses, like one breaking into a household. Let the drops exhilarate you, as lead horse, o sage poet, audacious one, when we beg you for a niggard: The impious rich man who has neglected to give to you bounteously, bring his possessions here to us. These comrades here, possessing the soma, watch out for you, Indra, as those who have flourishing (cattle) watch out for their livestock. And you, who are not deaf but have listening ears, do we call here from afar for help. When you should hear this call here, you should do (a deed) difficult to forget, and then you would become our most intimate friend. For even though we’ve thought that we’ve been going a wayward course to you, still become for us a giver of cows, Indra. As elderly men grasp a staff, we have grasped hold of you, lord of strength. We want you in our seat. Sing a praise song to Indra, the warrior of much manliness, whom none obstruct in battle. When it has been pressed, I set you loose on the pressed (soma) to drink it, o bull. Become satiated; come through to exhilaration. Let not the greedy dolts, let not the deriders deceive you. Do not cherish those who hate the sacred formulation. Here let the (soma drinks) with their profusion of cows [=milk] exhilarate you to generosity. Drink a lake, as a buffalo does. Those (deeds) that the Vr̥tra-smiter set in motion afar, both the old ones and the new, proclaim these at the assemblies: Indra drank the pressed (soma) of Kadrū for that which possesses a thousand-arms [=battle?]. Then he displayed his own masculine power. This is real: having obtained at Turvaśa’s and Yadu’s what is not to be spurned [=soma], he came through to victory by his labor. I laud him to you as the surpassing one, as driller of the bovine prize for the peoples, and as one common (to all)— As the master of the R̥bhus, not to be obstructed, as the strengthener of the son of Tugra [=Bhujyu] (do I laud him) in solemn words when the soma is pressed—Indra! Who cut apart the broad, womblike mountain for Triśoka, as a way for the cows to go forth. What you take on, have in mind, and, becoming exhilarated, set out to accomplish, don’t do that, Indra. Have mercy! For even a paltry deed of one such as you is famed on earth. Let your mind go (to us?), Indra. Just yours will be these glorifications and encomia, when, Indra, you will be merciful to us. Don’t smite us at a single offense, nor at two or three, nor at many, o champion. For I am afraid of one such as you—powerful, shattering, wondrous, vanquishing with his attack. Let me not find the lack of a comrade, nor of a son, o you of outstanding goods. Let your mind be turned here. [Indra to Maruts:] “You young bucks—who, (as if) unpaired, has said, as comrade to comrade, ‘I will leave (you)’? Who retreats from us?” [Maruts to Indra:] “Hey bull. So—when (the soma) was pressed, being insatiable you consumed a lot, sashaying around the lower depths like a guy with ‘the dog-killer’ [=the winning throw at dice].” I hold onto these two fallow bays of yours, yoked by speech, along with their chariot, so that you will give to the formulators. Split off all hatreds; parry oppressions. Smite the slighters. The craved good thing—bring that here. What is in a firm place, what in a solid place, Indra, what has been borne away into a deep place— the craved good thing—bring that here. The abundance given by you that the whole people of Manu will know— the craved good thing—bring that here."

Those who launch themselves in flight on their drives along the backs of the mountains— the sacrifice of those greatly noisy ones, the favor of those powerfully noisy ones (you are likely to attain) while the ceremony is pro(ceeding). O strongest Indra, bring here the shatterer of bad thoughts, (namely) wealth to be harnessed for us, o you who stir thought— preeminent (wealth), o you who stir thought. O winner, good winner, powerful, brilliant, most brilliant, liberal-spirited, sovereign king, (bring wealth) victorious through victory, victory-winning, enjoyable, foremost at the prize-contests. Let him come here—any non-god who has taken as great a gift as Vaśa Aśvya has taken from Pr̥thuśravas Kānita at the dawning of this (dawn) here. I have won sixty thousands in equine property, myriads, twenty hundreds of camels, ten hundreds of dusky mares, ten of those with three red spots, ten thousands of cows. Ten dusky (stallions), following wealth to fulfillment, straight-tailed, swift, skittish, have turned the felly homeward. These are the gifts of Pr̥thuśravas Kānita, the very generous. In giving a golden chariot, he has become the most bounteous patron. He has made his fame the highest. Vāyu, drive here to us for the extension and the spread (of our line) to be great and for bounty. For we have performed (a sacrifice) for you, for you to give much, to give greatly all at once. As the one who drives here with his horses at the breaking of the day— with the thrice seven seventies— (invigorated) with these soma drinks by the soma-pressers, (be ready) to give, you soma-drinker, drinker of the clear purified (soma). The one of good resolve who by his breath invigorated just this man here, to give something brilliant to me in the axle made of araṭu wood, in the presence of Nahuṣa, who is a good performer (of rituals) for (a god) who performs even better, You who are an independent king, in a wondrous form worthy of praise and bathed in ghee, o Vāyu— this drive (of yours), horse-impelled, dust-impelled, dog-impelled, pro(ceeds). Here it is now! Now then, I have won something dear to the vigorous one, sixty thousand (geldings, which are) just like stallions. Like cattle to their herd, the geldings approach, the geldings approach me. Then when in a roving band [=caravan] a hundred camels roared, then (I took) twenty hundreds from the Śvitnas. I, the inspired poet, took a hundred from Balbūtha Tarukṣa the Dāsa. These are your peoples here, Vāyu. With Indra as protector they become exhilarated; with the gods as protectors they become exhilarated. And now this great maiden, facing Vaśa Aśvya, with bright ornaments upon her, is led forth."

Make us conspicuous; make us better off, for now in the exhilaration of you, Soma, I think of myself as a rich man. I shall advance to prosperity. With a vigorous mind we would take a share of you when pressed, as of ancestral wealth. King Soma, lengthen our lifetimes, like the sun the dawning days. King Soma, be merciful to us with well-being. We are under your commandment: know this. Potency and battle fervor are on the rise, o drop. Don’t hand us over (to the battle fervor) of the stranger, at his wish. For as protector of our body, Soma, you have settled down in every limb, having your eyes on men. If we will confound your commandments, be merciful to us, as our good comrade, all the more, o god. Might I be accompanied by a tender-hearted comrade, who would not harm me when it has been drunk, o possessor of fallow bay horses. This soma here that has been deposited in us—for it I go to Indra to lengthen our lifetime. These famines and diseases have gone off. Those allied to darkness have shied away; they have become afraid. Soma has mounted us to his full extent. We have gone to where they lengthen lifetime. O forefathers, the drop that, once drunk, entered into our hearts, the immortal into the mortals, to this Soma we would do ceremonial honor with an oblation. May we be in his mercy and good grace. You, Soma, coming to agreement with the forefathers, extend through heaven and earth. To you, drop, we would do ceremonial honor with an oblation. May we be lords of riches. Protector Gods, speak on our behalf. Let sleep not master us, nor mumbling. May we, always dear to Soma, possessed of good heroes, announce the ceremonial honor. You, o Soma, confer vitality on us on all sides; you, as finder of the sun, possessing the eye of men—enter us. You, o drop, along with your help—protect us from behind and also from in front."

I sing that utmost strength of yours, Indra, for the divine assembly, that you smash Vr̥tra with your might, o lord of ability. – Auspicious are the gifts of Indra. He will make those who marvel at him into festive assemblies, as it were, throughout the generations of men. Indra knows his own distinctive sign: he is famed (for it). – Auspicious are the gifts of Indra. They have increased your new-born strength, Indra, increased you and your resolve many times, o you of many cows, under your shelter, bounteous one. – Auspicious are the gifts of Indra. I and you, o Vr̥tra-smasher—let us two yoke ourselves together for winnings. Even a hostile man, o master of the stones, will yield to the two of us, o champion. – Auspicious are the gifts of Indra. This is really true—and thus we shall praise this Indra—not false: he is the great weapon of death for the man who does not press soma, but many are his lights for the man who does press. – Auspicious are the gifts of Indra."

All heroic deeds, both done and to be done, are in Indra, whom the chants know as the very ceremony itself. When cries were sent surging to Indra by the clan belonging to the Five Peoples, through the power of their inspiration, through the power of his measure he laid the strangers low. He is peaceful dwelling. Here is the praise that follows you: you did these manly deeds; you furthered the turning of the wheel. (Viṣṇu) strode widely to the rice porridge for this bull to live on. (Indra) took it, as cattle do barley. Seeking help as we present this (praise hymn), through you (all) might we have skill as our father for the strengthening of the one accompanied by the Maruts [=Indra]. Yes indeed! through our chanters we cry out again and again for your establishment according to the ritual sequence, o champion. Let us conquer with you as our yokemate, Indra.

Do your best for wealth for us, as one knowing many things, o Indra, you who are equal to song. Help us in the decisive (contest for) spoils. Even from yonder, Indra, drive up close to us with hundred-prized, thousand-prized refreshment. Let’s go to the visionary thoughts of our visionary poet; with (the thoughts as) our steeds, o able one who breaks out the cows, might we conquer in battles, o possessor of the mace. We will make you take pleasure in our hymns, o you of a hundred resolves, as cows do in their pastures. Because all things in the mortal way are in accord with your desire, o you of a hundred resolves, we have arrived at our hopes, possessor of the mace. To you, o son of strength, the desirers of desires have turned. Nothing surpasses you, Indra. O bull, give aid to us with the awesome, dashing visionary thought that gains the most, and with plenitude. O Indra of a hundred resolves, that which now is the most brilliant exhilaration for you, with that you should now become exhilarated on the exhilarating drink— That of yours which possesses the brightest fame, which is the best smiter of Vr̥tra, Indra, that exhilaration which best gives strength. For we know what of yours was given by you—possessor of the stone, real drinker of soma— to all communities, wondrous one. Let our hymns encircle with rhythm the soma pressed for Indra for exhilaration. Let the bards chant their chant. He in whom are all splendors, in whom the seven who sit together [=priests] take pleasure, Indra do we invoke when the soma is pressed. The gods have stretched for themselves a noteworthy sacrifice among the Trikadrukas. Just him [=Indra] let our hymns increase. Let the drops enter you, like rivers the sea. Nothing surpasses you, Indra. O wakeful bull, with your greatness you encompass the portion of soma that is in your belly, Indra. Let the soma be fit for your cheek, o Indra, Vr̥tra-smiter, fit for your “fundament” the drops. Śrutakakṣa [“Famous Armpit”] sings fit for a horse, fit for a cow, fit for the “fundament” [/bestowal] of Indra. For fittingly you exert yourself when our soma drinks are pressed, Indra, fittingly for your giving, able one. Even from a distance our hymns reach you, possessor of the stone. Let us go fittingly to you. For as surely as you are one who acts the hero and as surely as you are a steadfast champion, just as surely is your thought to be realized— Just as surely has your giving, powerfully liberal one, been ordained by all the Ordainers. And so, Indra, (you are) in partnership with me. Do not become like an indolent formulator, o lord of prizes. Exhilarate yourself on the pressed soma accompanied by cows [=milk]. Let not (ill) intentions toward us guide us away from the sun into the nights, Indra. With you as yokemate, we would gain it. With just you as yokemate, Indra, we would respond to the challengers. You are ours; we are yours. For those seeking you, ever bellowing after you, will proceed just to you— your comrades, the bards, o Indra."

O Vr̥tra-smiter—whatever today you have risen over, o Sun, all that is under your will, Indra. Or if, o lord of settlements grown strong, you think, “I shall not die,” just that comes true for you. The soma drinks which have been pressed in the distance, which nearby, to all those do you go, Indra. We incite this Indra to smite great Vr̥tra. He will become a bullish bull. Indra is the one made for giving. Strongest is he when ensconced in exhilaration; brilliant is he who, deserving of soma, receives the (invitatory) call. Like a mace equipped with a hymn, powerful, not to be budged, he has waxed high, not to be laid low. Even in difficult going, make easy passage for us when you are hymned, o Indra who yearn for hymns, if you will so desire, bounteous one— You whose aim, whose sovereignty they never confound— neither god, nor the exalted folk. And the two goddesses, both the World-Halves, respect your unrepulsable forcefulness, o you of good lips. You fixed this fast in the black (cows) and in the reddish ones, and in the gray ones—the gleaming white milk. Then as all the gods strode away from the turbulent power of the serpent, the onslaught of the wild beast found them. And after that he became a covering for me: the Vr̥tra-smiter displayed his masculine nature— he for whom no rival has been born, he who cannot be laid low. Him famed as the best smiter of Vr̥tra, the propelling force of the settled peoples, do I inspire to great generosity to you (patrons).

On reaching exhilaration, (bring) wealth in thousands to us. Become a provider to the pious man. These pressed drinks here, accompanied by their wives [=waters], go eagerly in pursuit.

Hither let these two feasting companions, the pair of fallow bays with golden manes, convey (you) to the pleasure set out (for you). For you have these soma drinks here been pressed and the ritual grass strewn, o you of radiant goods [=Agni]. Convey Indra hither for the praisers— (Agni,) as you diffuse your skill through the luminous realms and distribute treasures to the pious man. (All of you,) recite to Indra for the praisers. I establish here your Indrian strength and set out all solemn words for you, o you of a hundred resolves. Be merciful, Indra, to the praisers. Bring us every good thing, every refreshment and nourishment, o you of a hundred resolves, when you will show us mercy, Indra. Bring us all welfare, o you of a hundred resolves, when you will show us mercy, Indra. We who have pressed soma call upon just you, best smiter of Vr̥tra, when you will show us mercy, Indra. Right up to our pressed soma with your fallow bays—drive, o lord of exhilarating drinks— right up to our pressed soma with your fallow bays. He who is known, now as before, as Indra, best smiter of Vr̥tra, possessing a hundred resolves— right up to our pressed soma with your fallow bays. For you, Vr̥tra-smiter, are the drinker of these soma-drinks— right up to our pressed soma with your fallow bays.

For him do the waters, the seven mothers, stand still—the rivers easy to cross, for men to traverse. They were pierced through by the archer, though he wavered—the thrice seven backs of the mountains fitted firmly together. No god nor mortal could surpass this—(the deeds) that the bull, grown strong, performed. The metal mace is an appendage of Indra; greatest power is in the two arms of Indra. The intentions of Indra are in his head exclusively; into his mouth they rush en masse, to (become speech) worthy to be heard. I consider you the most worthy of the sacrifice of those worthy of the sacrifice; I consider you the stirrer of the unstirrable; I consider you the beacon of warriors, Indra; I consider you the bull of the settled domains. When, o Indra, in your two arms you took the mace stirred by exhilaration, to smite the serpent, the mountains bellowed forth, and forth the cows, forth the formulators [=Maruts] approaching Indra. [Maruts:] “Let us praise him, who begat all these creatures here below him. We would like to establish an alliance with Indra with our hymns; we would come near the bull with reverences.” [Maruts:] “Shrinking from the hissing of Vr̥tra, all the gods who were your partners deserted you. Let your partnership be with the Maruts, Indra. Then you will win all these battles here.” [Maruts:] “We, the thrice sixty Maruts, having increased you as ruddy throngs [=herds of cattle] increase, are deserving of the sacrifice. We reverently approach you. Make a share for us. We would honor your unbridled force with this oblation.” [Maruts:] “Sharp is the weapon, the vanguard of the Maruts. (And) who dares venture against your mace, Indra? The lords lacking gods are weapon-less. With your wheel [=discus?] scatter them, possessor of the silvery drink.” For the great, strong, powerful one, for the one most propitious to cattle send forth a well-twisted (hymn). Produce many hymns for Indra whose vehicle is songs, for his body. Surely he will take cognizance (of them)? To him whose vehicle is hymns, to the far-ranging one send an inspired thought like (a boat) to the far shore of rivers with a wooden (paddle). Stroke the body of the famous, very enjoyable one with a visionary thought. Surely he will take cognizance (of it)? Labor at what Indra will enjoy from you. Give as praise a good praise hymn. Seek to entice him here with reverence. Be attentive, singer. Don’t screech, but make your speech heard. Surely he will take cognizance (of it)? The Droplet descended into the Aṃśumatī (River), the black one speeding with the ten thousand. Indra with his skill helped him as he blew. The manly minded one repelled the “blizzards” (of attacking warriors?). “I saw the Droplet wandering in the oscillating eddy of the Aṃśumatī River, descending like a black cloud. I dispatch you, bulls. Fight in the contest.” Then the Droplet held his body in the lap of the Aṃśumatī, as he glittered. With Br̥haspati as yokemate, Indra overcame the godless clans as they attacked. You then—just as you were being born, you became the rival to the seven unrivaled ones, Indra. You discovered heaven and earth, which were hidden. You provided joy to the wide-ranging creatures. You then—emboldened, you smote the power without counterpart with your mace, mace-bearer. You brought low (the power) of Śuṣṇa with your murderous weapons. You found the cows just with your skill, Indra. You then—bull of the settled domains, you became the forceful bane of obstacles. You released the rivers, which had been blocked. You conquered the waters whose husband was a Dāsa. “He is the very resolute one, who is the enjoyer of the pressings, to whom the battle-fury has been conceded, who is like a rich man through (all) the days, who all alone is the performer of manly labors.” “That’s the Vr̥tra-smiter!” they respond to the other. That’s the Vr̥tra-smiter—Indra, sustainer of the settled domains. Him who is to be invoked would we invoke with a lovely praise hymn. He is our bounteous helper, our advocate. He is the giver of the prize deserving of fame. That’s the Vr̥tra-smiter—Indra, the master of the R̥bhus. As soon as he was born, he became one to be invoked. Performing many manly labors, like soma when drunk he is to be invoked by his comrades."

The footprint of the generous god, with his unassailable forms of help, is an auspicious sight, like the sun. O god Agni, heating up with your flame through visions of ghee, convey the gods hither and sacrifice to them. The mothers, the gods begot you, the sage poet, o Aṅgiras, as immortal conveyor of the oblation. You, o sage Agni, a discerning messenger worthy to be chosen, have they installed as conveyor of the oblation. Because I have no cow, nor an axe in a wooden (tree), I therefore bring just a thing like this to you. When, Agni, we set any pieces of wood whatsoever in you, enjoy them, youngest one. What the little termite eats, what the ant creeps over, let all that be ghee for you. Kindling Agni with his mind, the mortal should follow his visionary thought. I have kindled Agni with the dawning lights."

For you do the milk-cows run. Drive forth, Soma, in a stream, pressed as exhilarating for Indra, establishing for yourself imperishable fame. Together the seven siblings cried out to you, inciting with insightful thoughts the inspired poet at the contest of Vivasvant. They groom you together, the unwed ones, on the sheep’s *back, in the lively (water), when, hoarse-voiced [/creaking], you are anointed [/greased] in the wood(en cup).

Enter here into the belly of Indra. Great are you, Soma, preeminent, strongest of the strong, o drop. Being a battler, you win every time.

Being pressed, the drop has flowed forth across the fleecy filter; being purified, the drop (has flowed) to Indra.

Swell forth, flow forth, Soma, with all your shoots as highest oblation for the gods. Close to the dear youth who always excites wonder, the one growing strong through the poured offering, have we come, bearing homage. The axe [=flame] of the one not to be stilled [=Agni] (has) disappeared. By purifying yourself bring it here, o god Soma, so also the rat [=Rudra?], o god Soma.

Winning cows for us, winning chariots and gold, winning the sun and the waters, winning thousands, Soma purifies himself, whom the gods have made their exhilarating draught for drinking, the sweetest ruddy drop, who is joy itself. O Soma, purifying yourself, you rush, seeking us, while making these treasures real. Smash the rival nearby and the one who is in the distance; make wide pasturage and fearlessness for us."

The heavenly, fine-feathered, honeyed drops, most exhilarating, take their seats around the cask. Forth have your swift, exhilarating, invigorating drinks surged, like chariot-horses, each separately. As a milk-cow (goes) to her calf with milk, the drops, the honeyed waves (go) to Indra, possessor of the mace. Like a steed being spurred, rush to the prize, to the cask of heaven, whose mother is the stone— you, the finder of the sun, the bullish Soma, being purified in the filter, on the sheep’s back, for Indra’s suckling. Forth have your heavenly (hymns), sped by insight, destined for the Aśvins, surged with their milk into the support, o self-purifying one. Forth within (the support) have the seers sent their substantial (hymns) surging—those ritual experts who groom you, o you who win seers [?]. Your beacons circle around all the domains, though you are in advance—you ingenious one whose gaze is on all. Reaching through (the domains), you purify yourself, Soma, according to your ordinances. You rule as lord of all creation. The rays, the beacons of the self-purifying one circle around on both sides, though he stays fixed. When the fallow bay is groomed in the filter, seated in his womb, he sits down in the tubs. Beacon of the sacrifice, lovely at the ceremony, he purifies himself. Soma proceeds toward the rendezvous with the gods. Having a thousand streams, he rushes around the cask. The bull keeps bellowing as he goes across the filter. The king plunges through the sea, the rivers. Fixed in the streams he accompanies the wave of waters. The self-purifying one has mounted upon the sheep’s back, on the navel of the earth, as buttress of great heaven. Thundering like the back of heaven he has roared, he according to whose ordinances both heaven and earth (abide). He purifies himself, always finding the fellowship of Indra. Soma, while being purified, sits in the tubs. Light of the sacrifice, he purifies himself as its dear honey, the father, begetter of the gods, possessing conspicuous goods. He establishes a secret treasure in the two independent powers [=Heaven and Earth], as the most invigorating exhilarating Indrian sap. Roaring toward the tub, the prize-seeker rushes, the lord of heaven with his hundred streams, wide-gazing. The fallow bay sits in the seats of Mitra, the bull constantly being groomed by the sheep, the streams. At the forefront of the rivers, purifying himself he rushes; at the forefront of speech he goes foremost among the cows. At the forefront of the prize(-contest) he takes great stakes as his share. The bull of good weapons is purified by the pressers. This one here, accompanied by thought, like a bird spurred on has run into the sheep’s (fleece), purifying himself in a wave. By your resolve, o sage poet, by your insight, the clear Soma purifies himself between the two world-halves for you, o Indra. Clothing himself in a mantle that touches heaven, the one worthy of the sacrifice, filling the midspace, is fitted into the worlds. While being born, he has stridden along the cloud toward the sun; he wishes to entice his age-old father here. He extends his great shelter to the clan, when he has reached through his first domain. What is his footprint in the highest distant heaven—from that he proceeds toward all the (streams) in uninterrupted array. Forth has the drop proceeded to the rendezvous with Indra: a comrade does not transgress against an agreement with his comrade. As a young blood rushes together with young women, so does Soma— into the tub, along a path with a hundred courses. Forth have your insights stridden, arousing exhilaration, expressing admiration, inviting admiration in their joint dwellings. The inspired thoughts, the rhythms have roared to Soma; the milk-cows have mixed him with milk. O Soma, o drop, purifying yourself, bring us continuous, swelling, unfailing refreshment by purifying yourself, (refreshment) that, never drying up, will milk out for us three times a day an abundance of good heroes, along with cattle, prizes, and honey. The bull of the thoughts, wide gazing, purifies himself—Soma, the lengthener of day, of dawn, of heaven. Through the action of the rivers he has made the tubs bellow, entering the heart of Indra through (the action of) the inspired ones. Through the inspired ones the primordial poet purifies himself; guided by men he has roared around the casks. Engendering the name of Trita, he flows as honey, to create the partnership of Indra and Vāyu. This one here, being purified, has made the dawns shine widely; this one has become the maker of wide space for the rivers. This one, having milked thrice seven (cows) for his own milk-mixture— the exhilarating Soma purifies himself in a way dear to the heart. Purify yourself, Soma, in the heavenly domains, surging into the tub, into the filter, o drop. Sitting in the belly of Indra, ever roaring, guided by the men, you have made the sun mount in heaven. Pressed by the stones, you purify yourself in the filter, o drop, entering the belly of Indra. You have become one whose gaze is on men, wide-gazing one. Soma, you opened up the cowpen for the Aṅgirases. You, o Soma, purifying yourself, do the very attentive poets applaud as they seek help. You did the fine-feathered (falcon) carry here from heaven, o drop, you who are adorned all over with all thoughts. Seven milk-cows roar toward the tawny one being purified on the sheep’s fleece in a wave all around. Into the lap of the waters, into the womb of truth have the Āyus, the buffaloes propelled the poet. The drop being purified plunges beyond the scorners, making all paths good for the worshipful one. Making the cows into his raiment, the delightful poet, playful like a steed, rushes around the fleece. Inexhaustible, possessing a hundred streams, excelling in beauty [/serving as mixture], they [=mixing waters] roar down to the tawny one as they provide water. The fingers groom him wreathed with cows, on the third back, in the luminous realm of heaven. Yours are these offspring of the heavenly semen; you rule over all creation. And all this here is under your will, self-purifying one. You are the foremost founder of foundations, o drop. You are the sea, o poet, the all-knowing [/-finding] one; yours are these five regions in your [/their] expansion. You have carried yourself beyond heaven and earth; yours are the lights, self-purifying one, and the sun. You, o self-purifying Soma, are purified for the gods in the filter, in the expansion of space. You did the fire-priests first grasp; to you have all these worlds submitted themselves. The husky-voiced one goes forth across the sheep’s fleece; the tawny bull has roared down into the woods [/wooden vessels]. The hymnic visions, bellowing [/in their longing], have roared together. The thoughts lick the child who always excites wonder. He has enveloped himself with the rays of the sun, stretching his own threefold thread, in the way that is known. Leading the newer directives of truth, as a husband he proceeds to the rendezvous with his wives. The king of rivers, the lord of heaven purifies himself. He proceeds along the paths of truth, ever roaring. The tawny one is poured around with his thousand streams as he is being purified, begetting speech, bringing goods near at hand. Purifying yourself as a great flood, brilliant like the sun, you run across the fleecy filters. Hand-purified by the men, pressed by the stones, you dash for the great rich prize. Self-purifying one, you rush toward refreshment and nourishment. Like a falcon in the woods, you sit in the tubs. For Indra is pressed the exhilarative, exhilarating drink of exhilaration, the utmost prop of heaven, wide-gazing. The seven sisters, as mothers, (go) to the newborn child of worthy birth, who is attentive to poetic inspiration, the heavenly Gandharva of the waters, whose gaze is on men—to Soma, for the regulation of all creation. Showing mastery, you speed across these worlds here, o drop, having hitched up your golden fine-feathered (mares). Let them stream honeyed ghee and milk for you. O Soma, let the separate peoples stay under your commandment. You, Soma, are one whose gaze is on men on every side. Purifying yourself, bull, you run across these (worlds). Purify yourself in a manner rich in goods and gold for us. May we be (fit) to live in the worlds. Purify yourself, as finder of cattle, of goods, of gold. Depositing seed, o drop, you are fitted into the worlds. You, Soma, are rich in good heroes, finder of all [/all-knowing]. These inspired poets here reverently approach you with a hymn. The wave of honey has raised (our?) desires; clothing himself in waters, the buffalo plunges through them. The king whose chariot is the filter has mounted the prize. He of a thousand spikes wins lofty fame. He rouses all blessings, consisting of offspring and easy to bear, through our whole lifetime, day upon day. Then, o drop, when drunk, on our behalf beg Indra for a sacred formulation bringing offspring and for wealth consisting of horses in the homestead. At the vanguard of the days [=dawn] the tawny, delightful, exhilarating drink makes himself conspicuous with his appearance through the days. Setting in place the two peoples [=gods and men], he speeds between them in upholding the “praise of men” and the heavenly (praise). They anoint him—anoint him separately and jointly. They lick (him who is) resolve; they anoint him with honey— him, the ox flying in the burbling up of the river. (The waters,) who purify the gold (of soma), grasp the stock-animal within themselves. Sing to the self-purifying one who is attentive to poetic inspiration. Like a great stream he rushes beyond his stalk; like a snake he slinks beyond his withered skin. Playful like a steed, the tawny bull has run. Going in the vanguard, the king who is found in the waters displays his power, the measure(r) of the days, fitted into the worlds. The ghee-backed fallow bay, a flood lovely to see, having light as his chariot, accustomed to wealth, purifies himself. It has been sent surging—the prop of heaven, the exhilarating drink held aloft. It rushes threefold around the worlds. The thoughts lick the plant that always excites wonder, when the versifiers have come to array it with a hymn. Your streams go forth beyond the fine (hairs) of the ewe; as you are being purified, there go continuous charges. When, o drop, you are anointed with cows in the two cups, being pressed you sit in the tubs, Soma. Purify yourself, Soma, finding the will, to be hymned by us. Run around in the sheep’s fleece as dear honey. Smite all rapacious demons, o drop. – May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes."

O drop, impart vitality to our speech. – Do you protect us always with your blessings."

Making the invocations of Indra beneficial for his comrades, Soma puts on his ravishing garments. The tawny ones [=fingers] jointly groom his tawny (horse), without resting, with acts of reverence that spur on the horse. The comrade of Indra mounts the chariot; the knowing one drives with him to our good thought. Purify yourself, o god, for the conclave of gods, for great delight, o Soma, as Indra’s drink. Creating the waters and making this heaven rain, from the wide (realm) make wide space for us as you are being purified. For freedom from overthrow and freedom from assault purify yourself, for well-being, for lofty wholeness. This do all these comrades desire; this do I desire, o self-purifying Soma. Soma purifies himself—the begetter of poetic thoughts, begetter of heaven, begetter of earth, begetter of Agni, begetter of the sun, begetter of Indra, and begetter of Viṣṇu.

Stand side-by-side by Indra. Generate weapons. Purify yourself, Soma, rich in honey, following the truth, clothing yourself in waters, on the sheep’s back. Sit down in the cups full of ghee as the most elating, exhilarating drink for Indra. Having a hundred streams, purify yourself into the rain from heaven— thousand-winning, seeking the prize in pursuit of the gods, bellowing along with the rivers in the tub, along with the ruddy (cows), prolonging our lifetime. This very Soma, being purified by poetic thoughts, like a prizewinning steed just outstrips hostilities. Like the milk milked out of Aditi, it is invigorating, broad like a way, like a draft-horse easy to control. Having good weapons, being purified by the pressers, rush to the dear hidden name (of the cows? of Indra?), to the prize, like a team with desire for fame, to Vāyu, to the cows, o god Soma. The colt just born, the delightful one they groom; the Maruts in a flock beautify the cart horse.

Having the mind of a seer, a maker of seers, gaining the sun, having a thousand devices, trail-blazer for poets, a buffalo, seeking to gain the third domain, Soma, as rhythm [/the anuṣṭubh meter], regulates the virāj (meter) according to rule. Sitting in the cups, the falcon, the bird spreading (his wings), the cow-finding drop, bearing weapons, accompanying the wave of the waters, the buffalo declares the sea to be the fourth domain. Like a resplendent young blood grooming his own body, like a steed running to gain the stakes, charging around the cask like a bull around the herds, constantly roaring he has entered the two cups. Purify yourself, o drop, as self-purifying one, with your mighty powers. Constantly roaring, rush around the fleeces. Playing, enter the two cups while being purified. Let your exhilarating sap exhilarate Indra. His lofty streams have been sent surging forth. Anointed with cows he has entered the tubs. Making a melody [/performing the sāman], devoted to a melody [/the sāman], attentive to poetic inspiration, roaring he goes as if to a comrade’s sister. Smiting aside the rivals, self-purifying one, you go like a swain to his beloved, the drop besung. Sitting in the woods like a flying bird, Soma, being purified, has settled in the tubs. As you purify yourself, Soma, your beams come here like a maiden— the good milkers giving good streams. The fallow bay granting many favors, led hither into the waters, has roared in the tub of those who seek the gods."

The dear one is groomed on the sheep’s back, the more glorious of the glorious ones, a fellow countryman at our side. Cry out, run, as you are being purified. – Do you protect us always with your blessings. Sing forth: let us recite to the gods. Impel Soma for great stakes. The sweet one will purify himself across the sheep’s fleece. He will sit in the tub, seeking the gods for us.

Let your exhilarating drink go to Indra for the taking. Drive on the same chariot with the gods to bounty. – Do you protect us always with your blessings. Speaking forth his poetry like Uśanā, the god proclaims the races of the gods. Of great commandment, of blazing lineage, pure, as a boar he goes rasping toward his tracks. The geese have journeyed forth to (Soma’s) sharp battle-fury, from nearby to their home, in a bullish flock. The comrades speak in unison to the self-purifying one a songful music difficult to forget. He hastens at the pace of the wide-ranging one [=Viṣṇu?]. The cows, as they seem to bellow, give their measure to the one who plays at will [=Soma]. The sharp-horned one makes himself an ample (face). By day he appears tawny, but silvery by night. The prizewinning drop purifies himself, bringing cows down in flood— Soma stimulating the power in Indra, for exhilaration. He smashes demonic force; he deflects hostilities, making wide space as king of the community. Then being infused with honey in a stream, he purifies himself across the fleece, when he has been milked by the stone, the drop enjoying the fellowship of Indra, the god, the exhilarating drink of the god, for exhilaration. He purifies himself toward his own dear (tracks?), while being purified, the god infusing the gods with his own sap. The drop, clothing himself in his foundations according to the ritual order, has enwrapped himself in the ten fingers on the back of the sheep. The ruddy bull keeps roaring at the cows; bellowing he goes to heaven and earth. His voice, like Indra’s, is heard at the contest. He rushes, making this speech perceptible here. Good to taste, swelling with milk, you go, setting in motion the honeyed plant. Purifying yourself, you go, producing thunder, while being poured around for Indra, o Soma. Purify yourself thus, an exhilarating one for exhilaration, bowing with your weapons (those) of the water-grasper. Encompassing the glistening color, seeking cows, rush to us, when you are poured around, o Soma. Having taken pleasure, o drop, (making) easy pathways easy to travel for us, purify yourself on a broad (path), making us wide spaces. Smashing asunder obstacles to progress as if with a deadly weapon, run along the back, on the sheep’s back. Stream rain to us—heavenly, hurrying, bringing refreshment, luck for the livestock, of lively drops. Run, pulling apart [=discriminating] these bonds here below, these webs, like straightened curls, o drop. Untie like a knot the straight and the crooked way that are knotted up, when you are being purified, o Soma. Like a fallow bay steed you whinny on being let loose; run, o god, as a man in his prime in possession of a dwelling place. Delightful, for the divine conclave for exhilaration, run around the back, on the sheep’s back. Possessing a thousand streams, sweet-smelling, not to be outwitted, flow around at the winning of prizes, at the victory over superior men. Though without reins, without chariot, not yoked, having been let loose like steeds in a contest, these gleaming soma-drinks run. O gods, drive right up to them, to drink them. Thus, o drop, flow around the cloud, the flood in the cups, toward our pursuit of the gods. Let Soma give to us desirable, lofty wealth, powerful and abounding in heroes. When the speech from the mind of the seeker fashioned him [=Soma] on the foundation of the preeminent one [=Agni or Indra?] or face-to-face with the cattle, thereupon the cows came to him at will, bellowing—to the delightful husband, the drop, in the tub. The divine giver of drops, sweller of drops, (goes) forth. As truth, he purifies himself for truth, the very wise one. Possessing the (royal) mandate, he has become the king of what belongs to the community. He has been brought forward to the earth by the ten reins. Purifying himself with the filters, having his gaze on men, as the king of gods and mortals he has become once again the wealth-lord of wealth; the drop bears the pleasing truth that is easy to bear. Like a steed rushing to a win for the sake of fame, rush to the pursuit of Indra and Vāyu. Give us a thousand lofty refreshments; become a finder of chattels while you are being purified, o Soma. Pursuing the gods while being poured around, let the soma drinks run to a dwelling place rich in good heroes, bringing favor here through sacrifice, possessing all desirable things, sacrificing at day(break) like Hotars, most gladdening. Thus, o god Soma, purify yourself for the conclave of gods, for their great delight, as the gods’ drink, for we are greatly driven at the encounter. Make the two world-halves of good standing while you are being purified. Like a horse you whinny on being yoked by the bulls, fearsome like a lion, swifter than mind. Along paths turned hitherwards—those which are the straightest— bring benevolence here to us by purifying yourself, o drop. A hundred god-generated streams have been sent surging; these thousand the poets groom. O drop, by purifying yourself bring here from heaven a means of winning. You are the leader of great spoils. Like surges from heaven, (like those) of days, his surges have surged. Like a king, the wise one does not violate his alliance. Being put in your place according to our intentions, like a son according to the intentions of his father, bring freedom from overthrow here to this clan by purifying yourself. Your honeyed streams have surged forth, when, purified, you go across the sheep’s fleece. Self-purifying one, purify yourself as the domain for the cows. On being born, you swelled the sun with rays [/chants]. Ever roaring along the path of truth, gleaming you radiate across the domain of the immortal one [=sun?]. Providing the means for exhilaration, you purify yourself for Indra, spurring on your own speech with the thoughts of the poets. As heavenly eagle, o Soma, gaze down, swelling the streams with (ritual) action in the pursuit of the gods. O drop, enter the tub for holding the soma. Roaring, come right up to the ray of the sun. The draft-horse rouses forth the three voices, the hymnic vision of truth, the inspired thought of the sacred formulation. The cows go asking for a cowherd; the thoughts go bellowing eagerly to Soma. To Soma (go) the milk-cows bellowing eagerly; to Soma the inspired poets asking for him with their thoughts. Soma, pressed, is purified while being anointed [/driven]; to Soma the chants, the triṣṭubh verses cry out together. Thus, o Soma, being poured around, being purified, bring well-being here to us through your purification. Enter Indra with a lofty shout; strengthen speech, beget plenitude. In accordance with truth, the wakeful inspired poet of the thoughts, Soma, being purified, has sat down in the cups, he whom they serve, eager in rivalry—the Adhvaryus of good hands, the charioteers (of the sacrifice). He, being purified close by, like the Placer of the Sun has filled both world-halves, and he has disclosed them. He with whose help the winners of dear things (win) dear things, he will extend spoils as if to a victor. The strengthening strengthener, being purified, Soma the rewarder, helped us with his light, with which our forefathers, knowing the track, finding the sun, burned the cows out of the rock. As the sea he has roared at his first expansion, begetting the creatures as king of creation. The bull in the filter, on the sheep’s back, Soma has grown loftily, the drop being pressed. Soma the buffalo performed this great (deed), that [/when] as embryo of the waters he chose the gods. Purifying himself, he placed strength in Indra. The drop begat the light in the sun. Exhilarate Vāyu for his quest and for our benefit; exhilarate Mitra and Varuṇa, while you are being purified. Exhilarate the Marutian troop; exhilarate the gods; exhilarate Heaven and Earth, o god Soma. Purify yourself, as the straight smiter of the crooked, thrusting away affliction and insults, perfecting your milk with the milk of cows. You are (the comrade) of Indra; we are your comrades. Purify yourself into the sweetness of honey, into a wellspring of goods; by purifying yourself bring here to us a hero and a portion. Sweeten yourself for Indra as you purify yourself, o drop, and by purifying yourself bring here to us wealth from the sea. Soma, pressed in a stream, driving like a steed, has streamed like a river to the deep, as prizewinner. He has sat in the wooden womb while being purified. The drop has flowed together with the cows, with the waters. This very Soma purifies himself for you, o Indra, in the cups, insightful and powerful for you who desire it— the charioteer having the eye of the sun, whose impetuosity is real, who has been sent surging like the desire of those who seek the gods. He, being purified with age-old vitality, hiding himself in the forms of the daughter (of the Sun [=Dawn]) [=milk], in the waters clothing himself in shelter providing threefold defense, rasping like a Hotar he drives to the concourses. Now, you, o god Soma, as charioteer—flow around for us in the two cups, while being purified, sweetest in the waters, honeyed, truthful, you whose thoughts become reality, like god Savitar’s. Rush toward Vāyu in pursuit while being hymned, toward Mitra and Varuṇa while being purified, toward the superior man who quickens insightful thought and bestrides the chariot, toward Indra the bull with the mace in his arms. Rush toward your garments that garb well, toward the good-milking cows, while being purified, toward glittering golden goods, to bring them to us, and toward chariot horses, o god Soma. Rush toward heavenly goods for us, toward all earthly goods, while being purified, toward that by which we shall win property, (that is,) toward a seer’s (portion) for us like that of Jamadagni. By purifying yourself with this purification bring goods here in this way. O drop, at (the time of) the hiding of the moon [=early morning] run forth into the lake. The copper-colored (Sun/Fire), sped like the wind, is also there. The very wise one [=Soma?] also gives (to us) the superior man [=Indra?] to make the charge. And with this purification purify yourself for us at the famous ford of the (prize/wealth) worthy of fame [=place of distribution of dakṣiṇās?]. The challengers’ challenger [=Indra?] will shake off sixty thousand goods like ripe (fruit) from a tree, for our joy. Of him—“Bull” his name—there are these two great forceful weapons of death either at the hiding of the moon or at the caressing [=mixing soma with milk]: he put the challengers to sleep and “snowed” them. Turn back from here those without alliance (with us), back those without perception. You converge on the three filters stretched out, but you run along just one while you are being purified. You are Bhaga, you are the giver of the gift; you are bounteous to the bounteous ones, o drop. This one, knowing all, possessing inspired thoughts, purifies himself— Soma, the king of all creation. Rousing the droplets at the rites, the drop proceeds over and across the sheep’s fleece all at once. The undeceivable buffaloes lick the drop. On his track the poets squawk like birds of prey. The insightful ones impel him with their ten fingers. They jointly anoint his form with the sap of the waters. With you who purify yourself, o Soma, we would pull out the perfect (“hand” of dice) at the match, time after time. – This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant this to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven."

The most honeyed pressed soma drinks, exhilarating to Indra, provided with filters, have flowed. Let your exhilarating drinks go to the gods. “The drop purifies himself for Indra,” so the gods said. The lord of speech does battle [/seeks bounties], holding sway over all with his strength. Possessing a thousand streams he purifies himself, a sea setting speech aswing, Soma, lord of riches, comrade of Indra, day after day. This one here is Pūṣan, Wealth, Fortune; Soma rushes as he is being purified. As lord of all creation, he has surveyed both world-halves. Together the dear ones have cried out to him, the cows avid for exhilaration. The soma drinks make their own paths, the self-purifying drops. The one who is strongest [=Indra], bring him here, o self-purifying one, the one worthy of fame, who sur(mounts) the five domains, with whom we shall gain wealth. The soma drops purify themselves, as best pathfinders for us, allies, unblemished, rich in purpose, finding the sun, when they are being pressed. Having been pressed by the stones, conspicuous on the hide of the cow, the finders of goods have roared together from all around toward refreshment for us. These purified soma juices, attentive to poetic inspiration, mixed with curds, are worthy to be seen like suns, mobile yet fixed in the ghee. Like a mortal he [=the dog] has shown preference for the speech of the stalk being pressed. Smite away the dog, the ungenerous one, as the Bhr̥gus (did) the Battler. Their kinsman has wrapped himself in a cloak (of milk) to enjoy it, like a son in the two arms (of his mother). He runs like a swain to a maiden, like a wooer, to sit in the womb. He is a hero, bringing skill to realization, who has propped apart the two world-halves. The tawny one has wrapped himself in the filter, like a ritual adept, to sit in the womb. Soma purifies himself with the fleeces of sheep, on the cow’s hide. Ever roaring, the bullish fallow bay goes to his rendezvous with Indra."

Those divine sequential-sacrificers—along with them, o Agni, you are the best sacrificer among the Hotars. Pursue the office of Hotar and of Potar of the peoples. You are the Establisher of Thought and the Giver of Wealth, possessing the truth. (When) at the svāhā-call we shall make the oblations, let Agni the god sacrifice to the gods, (himself) deserving it. We have come along the path of the gods, to carry forward along it what we can. Agni is the one who knows: he will perform the sacrifice; just he is the Hotar. He will arrange the rites, he the ritual sequences. If we shall confound the commandments of you who know, o gods—we who are so very unknowing— knowing Agni fulfills all this through the ritual sequences by which he will arrange the gods. If, naively in their thinking and scant in skill, mortals do not pay heed to the sacrifice, discerning Agni, the Hotar, finding the resolve, will sacrifice to the gods as best sacrificer according to the ritual sequence. Because the begetter has begotten you as the face of all the rites, their brilliant beacon, so win by sacrifice, throughout the lands filled with superior men, eagerly sought cattle-rich refreshments belonging to all peoples. You whom Heaven and Earth, you whom the waters, you whom Tvaṣṭar, the good begetter, has begotten, you, knowing the way along the path leading to the forefathers—once kindled, beam brilliantly in all directions, o Agni."

Your brother does not want this, well-portioned one. [Yamī:] You jerk, you really are a jerk, Yama! Truly we have not found mind and heart in you.

Those who have thirsted, panting, among the gods, those knowing the priestly functions, those fashioned by praise along with chants— with them, o Agni, drive here, turned this way—with the forefathers who are good to find and truly here, the poets who sit by the gharma drink. Those who are truly here—eating oblations, drinking oblations, taking their place on the same chariot with Indra, with the gods— with them, o Agni, drive here—with the thousand god-extolling, further, earlier forefathers, who sit by the gharma-drink. Sweetened by Agni, o forefathers, come here. Sit each on his own seat, you of good guidance. Eat the oblations set forth on the ritual grass. Then provide wealth in hale heroes. You, Agni Jātavedas, reverently invoked, have conveyed the oblations, having made them very fragrant. You have presented them to the forefathers; they have eaten them at (the cry of) “svadhā.” (Now) you, o god—eat the oblations set forth. Both the forefathers who are here and those who are not here, both those whom we know and those whom we do not know, you know how many they are, o Jātavedas. Through your own powers [/at svadhā-calls], enjoy the well-performed sacrifice. Those burned by fire and those not burned by fire who become exhilarated at (the cry of) “svadhā” in the middle of heaven, along with them (go) as sovereign king (on the way) leading to (the other) life. Arrange your body as you wish."

Pūṣan knows all these regions through and through: he will lead us along the least perilous (way).

On the forward path of paths was Pūṣan born, on the forward path of heaven, on the forward path of earth. He wanders back and forth to both the dearest seats, foreknowing. Sarasvatī do those seeking the gods invoke, Sarasvatī when the ceremony is being extended. Sarasvatī did those of good action invoke. Sarasvatī will give a thing of value to the pious. O Sarasvatī, you who drove on the same chariot with the forefathers, becoming exhilarated at the svadhā(-calls), o goddess— having taken your seat here on this ritual grass, bring yourself to exhilaration. Provide us refreshments that bring no disease. Sarasvatī, whom the forefathers invoke, as they arrive at the sacrifice in the south— provide here a portion of refreshment worth thousands and thriving of wealth among the sacrificers. Let the waters, the mothers cleanse us; let them, ghee-pure, purify us with their ghee, for the goddesses carry forth every defilement. I rise up from them gleaming, purified. The drop spurted through the first days, both through this womb here and the former one. I offer the drop circling around through the same womb, according to the seven priestly functions. Your drop that spurts and your plant that is set in motion by the arms, from the lap of the Holy Place, or from the Adhvaryu or from the filter, that one of yours I offer with my mind when the vaṣaṭ-cry is made. Your drop that has spurted, your plant, and what is below and what beyond the ladle— let this god Br̥haspati pour it all together for benefit.

Lofty but without a shadow and without foliage is the steed [=kindling stick]. The mother [=lower fire stick] stands still; unloosed the embryo eats. Licking the calf of another, she [=oblation] lows. In what form did the milk-cow deposit her udder? Seven heroes [=Seven Seers?] came up from the south, eight from the north: they joined together. Nine [=Navagvas?] with grain sacks [?] came from the west, ten [=Daśagvas?] in the east traverse the back of the rock. One brownish one [=fire], common to the ten (fingers)—they spur on to decisive resolve. The mother bears the embryo well-placed in her belly—him seeking after nothing, she being content. The heroes cooked a fat ram; there were dice strewn down for gaming. Two roam the lofty steppe [=heaven?], provided with filters, purifying (soma?) in the waters. Shrieking, they went apart in opposite directions: one half will cook, for the other half does not cook. This god Savitar here says this to me, “Only he whose food is wood, whose food is melted butter will win.” I saw the horde [=year?] on the move from afar, turning by its own power, without a wheel. It escorts forward the generations of peoples of the stranger, diminishing their “tails” at the same time as transforming itself ever anew. These two oxen of the Pulverizer [=old age? death?] have been yoked for me. Do not drive (them) forth; wait just an instant. The waters also come through to the goal of this one, and he has come into being as the Harmer below the sun. This is the mace that has been rolled out in many ways, below the fullness of the lofty sun. But there exists other fame beyond this. Unwaveringly, old age crosses to it. Held in check within every tree, the cow [=fire?] will bellow. From there the man-eating birds [=flames?] will fly forth. Then all this creation here will be afraid, though pressing (soma) for Indra and doing its best for the seer. The first of the gods stood still at the measuring (of the sacrificial ground?); the later ones of them came up from the cutting (of it). Three marshy places [=fire hearths?] heat the earth; the two (horses?) convey the “stammerer” [?] [=Indra?] to the fullness (of the sacrifice? of the sun?). This is your means of life. And know this—don’t hide away such a thing in the clash— when the sun reveals itself, it hides the mist [?]. Its “foot” is released as if from a garment."

In all communities I protect him who, having pressed the soma, fills both my cheeks. [Singer/Sacrificer:] With a stone they press the exhilarating, powerful soma-drinks for you, Indra. You drink of them. They cook bulls for you. You eat of them—coming when you are summoned with nourishment, bounteous one. [Indra:] Mark well this (speech) of mine, singer: The rivers carry the flotsam against their current. The fox crept up on the lion, his opponent; the jackal sprang on the boar from out of the underbrush. [Singer/Sacrificer:] How shall I mark this (speech) of yours—I, a simple man, mark the inspired thought of you who are clever and strong? You who know will declare to us at the proper time toward which half your chariot-pole is to come to rest, bounteous one. [Indra:] Because in this way they grow me strong, higher even than lofty heaven is my chariot-pole. Many thousands do I “grind down” all at once, for the begetter begot me as one without rival. [Indra:] Because in this way they begot [/knew] me as strong and powerful, at every action (calling) “o Indra” (to me,) the bull—the gods (did this)— I smashed Vr̥tra with the mace, while exhilarated; I opened up the enclosure through my greatness for the pious one. [Indra:] The gods came; they carried axes; hewing the trees, they advanced with their clans toward (the ritual ground), depositing the good wood in the belly [=the hearth(s) of the ritual fires]. Where there is brushwood [?], they [=flames?] burn it up. [Indra:] The hare swallowed the razor coming toward it. I split apart a rock with an earth clod from afar. Even a lofty one shall I weaken for a weakling. The calf, swelling up, will pursue the bull. The eagle caught its talon just so, like a lion entrapped into a snare. The buffalo also got trapped, when it was thirsty. The monitor-lizard plowed this way for him. The monitor-lizard will plow this way for those who taunt the brahmins with their food. The very same ones eat the released oxen, themselves breaking their powers, their own bodies. But these (others) have become very fortunate by their ritual labors— the ones who urged themselves on at the soma(-pressing) with their hymns. Speaking manfully, measure out prizes to us; in heaven you have established your fame, your name as “hero.”"

There are your cows, o gambler, there your wife.” In this way does Savitar here, protector of the stranger, watch out for me. [To all the dice:] Make alliance (with us) now; have pity on us.

Even of the blind man, o Nāsatyas, even of the starving, even of the broken—they say just you are their healers.

You two dug Vandana out from the antelope snare. You two in an instant made Viśpalā go. You two raised up Rebha, set in hiding and already dead, o bullish Aśvins. You two made the earth-cleft and the heated (pot) comfortable for Atri, for Saptavadhri.

O you two kings and Aditi—not from anywhere does distress or difficulty or fear reach him for whom you arrange that his chariot, along with his wife, will be in front, o Aśvins good to invoke, you who follow the course of the Rudras [=Maruts]. Drive here with your chariot swifter than thought, which the R̥bhus made for you, o Aśvins, and at whose hitching up the Daughter of Heaven [=Dawn] is born and both bright-lit day halves of Vivasvant. You drove your course with your victorious (chariot) through the mountain. You made the milk-cow swell for Śayu, o Aśvins. With your powers you two freed the quail, which had been swallowed, even from within the mouth of the wolf. We have made this praise song for you, o Aśvins.

You have become the paired herdsmen, the two lords of beauty. Dear to Aryaman, might we reach his porticos. Reaching exhilaration in the dwelling of Manu, provide wealth along with heroes to the eloquent one. Make a ford that offers good drink, o lords of beauty. Smash away the post standing in our path, the malevolence. Where today and among which clans do the wondrous Aśvins, the lords of beauty, find exhilaration? Who has held them down?

I, the bull, held fast the seven streams that were flowing and racing upon the earth. I of good resolve traverse the floods. Through fighting I found the way for Manu to seek. I held fast in them that which the god Tvaṣṭar never held fast in them: the gleaming, eagerly sought (milk) in the udders, in the bellies of the cows, the honey of honey, the swelling soma, and its milk-mixture. Thus in this way Indra sought to attract the gods and men to him; with his stirring (action) he be(stirred them)—the bounteous one whose generosity is real. All these (deeds) of yours do the powerful ones sing, you able master of the fallow bays, whose glory is your own."

Yet you dwell in darkness, Agni. Make the paths leading to the gods easily passable. Convey the oblations, showing your benevolence. [Agni:] The brothers of Agni earlier kept rolling along after this business, like a charioteer along the road. In fear of this, Varuṇa, I went far away. I flinched from it like a buffalo from the bowstring of an archer. [Gods:] We will make a lifetime for you, which is free from old age, Agni, so that yoked (to your task) you will not suffer harm, Jātavedas. Then will you, showing your benevolence, convey their portion of the oblation to the gods, o well-born one?

Just he, as the winner (at the contest), (stands ready) for the man who can be outwitted to give: Cyavāna measured out his altar with “sweet” (dregs), but Tūrvayāṇa, whose speech is the most welcome, poured enduring semen like a gush— (Tūrvayāṇa)—to whose invocations you two [=Aśvins] run and win inspired words, (produced) by his skill, that are like sharp thinking, he who, powerfully manly, with arrows in his hand, brought his aim to fulfillment. “When black (Night) is sitting among the ruddy cows (of Dawn), o Aśvins, I call upon you two, the sons of heaven. Pursue my sacrifice, come here to my food, like winners to refreshment, as the two of whom no deception can be remembered.” He whose (penis,) which performs the virile work, stretched out, discharging (the semen)—(that one,) the manly one, then pulled away (his penis, which had been) “attending on” (her). Again he tears out from the maiden, his daughter, what had been “brought to bear” on her—he the unassailable. When what was to be done was at its middle, at the encounter when the father was making love to the young girl— as they were going apart, the two left behind a little semen sprinkled down on the back and in the womb of the well-performed (sacrifice). When the father “sprang on” his own daughter, he, uniting (with her), poured down his semen upon the earth. The gods, very concerned, begat the sacred formulation, and they fashioned out (of it?) the Lord of the Dwelling Place, protector of commandments. Like a bull in a contest he threw off foam. Heedless, she went away, hither and yon. Twisting away, she hastened like the Gift-Cow on foot. [The father:] “Now those caresses of mine have not grasped (her).” Right away, like a chariot-horse (came) the trampling of the offspring [=Agni], and he took his seat at the udder, as one naked in the cold takes a seat close to the fire. He gained the kindling wood and he gained the prize; he was born as the upholder, ever doing battle with his strength. Right away the Navagvas came to the fellowship of the maiden [=Dawn] and, speaking the truth, to the yoking of truth. Those who approached the protector [=Vala?] of doubly exalted (Dawn?), though they lacked the Gift-Cow, strove to milk the immovable ones [=Vala rocks?]. Right away they hastened anew to the fellowship of the maiden and to the semen, which was like a bounty, which is just truth— your blazing legacy, which they gained through sacrifice, and the milk of the ruddy female who gives sap as milk. When afterward they became aware of their separation from the livestock, he [=Br̥haspati or Indra] speaks thus, while bestowing (gifts) at the speaking: “Through the goodness of the good one, the bards are blameless. He exerts control over all movable property, all the way up to cattle.” They came just then as its besiegers; sitting (a session) for many (days), they strove to split (the fortress?) of Nr̥ṣada. The unassailable one disclosed what was knotted together, what was hidden, of Śuṣṇa, who was propagated in many ways. “Luster” is the name (of him), to whom the gods belong, who have set him down in his triple seat like the sun, and “Agni Jātavedas” is his name. Hear us, o Hotar, as our Hotar of truth, free of deception. And these two sons of Rudra, the Nāsatyas who possess the chant, are to be greeted and offered sacrifice by me, o Indra— the two who give (gifts) to him who, like Manus, provides the twisted ritual grass; the delightful pair for whom pleasing offerings are set out; and the two that seek sacrifice among the clans. This king praised here has been extolled as a ritual adept, and as inspired poet he crosses the waters, creating his own bridge. He sets Kakṣīvant atremble and also Agni, as the swift-running wheel of a steed does its wheel-rim. He of two lineages, the son of Vitaraṇa, the sacrificer, is to milk the milk-cow, which is sap-yielding but not giving birth, when I enmesh Mitra and Varuṇa with hymns and Aryaman with preeminent defenses. The patron whose lineage this is, setting your insight in heaven, Nābhānediṣṭha [/nearest to the navel], murmurs as he quests: “Is this navel of ours highest or is his? I was the so-many-eth after that one.” [Agni:] “This, here, is my navel, and here is my seat. These gods here are mine, and here am I—the whole— having two births, first born of truth. This (earth?) here did the cow give as her milk as she was being born.” Now among these (clans) the gladdening, far-radiant spoked wheel [=Agni] unhitches, the one having a double track, victorious within the wood. When the child of the house is like an upright line, right away the mother gives birth to the sturdy one, who grows strong with kindness. And now the cows of the maiden [=Dawn] have gone forth, following the distribution (of goods) of someone swollen (with wealth). Listen to us, o you possessing good movable property; you, perform sacrifice! I have grown strong through the liberal gifts of Āśvaghna [/son of the horse-killer]. And now you, Indra—know us for the sake of great wealth, o lord of men with the mace in your arms, and guard those generous to us and protect our blameless patrons in your charge, o possessor of fallow bays. And now, o you two kings [=Mitra and Varuṇa, or the Aśvins], when in the quest for cattle the hastening one, awakening, makes haste for the bard, the dearest inspired poet [=Agni?], because he has become theirs [=patrons’], will carry them away and will bring them across. And now at the thriving of him [=Agni] who is well born—we, rasping at will, now beg this: [see vs. 27]— you, his son, are a hastening horse and an inspired poet—as also at the winning of fame. If for the sake of companionship with you two [=Mitra and Varuṇa, or the Aśvins], for us who are his troop, he [=Agni/poet], receiving [/providing] reverence, finds pleasure in his praise hymn— he in whom songs in all places come together, like a route with many parts—and he does ritual service for the sake of liberality, He, being sung by the waters and with the gods on his side, is thus “of good lineage.” With reverence and hymns, with solemn words and speeches, he strengthens (the gods?), for now (he has) arrived. The (ceremonial) course departs from the “milk” of the ruddy one [=Dawn].

Just these seers are the Virūpas [/of various forms]; just they possess profound inspiration. They are the sons of the Aṅgiras; they were born from Agni. The Virūpas [/those of various forms] who were born from Agni and from heaven, Navagva, Daśagva, the best of the Aṅgirases: in company with the gods, (each) is generous. With Indra as their yokemate, the cantors set loose the pen filled with cows and horses. Giving me a thousand (cows) with cut-branded ears, they made fame for themselves among the gods. Now let this Manu be propagated and let him grow like a sprout— he who is magnanimous in giving all at once a thousand (cows) along with a hundred horses. No one succeeds in taking hold of him any more than the back of heaven. The priestly gift of Sāvarṇya spreads out like a river. And also two barbarian-slaves to perform service, each with his allotted (gear), along with an abundance of cows, have Yadu and Turva (each) magnanimously bestowed. Let Manu, giver of thousands, leader of the horde, not suffer harm. Let his priestly gift come, aligning itself with the sun. Let the gods extend the lifetime of Sāvarṇi, under whose auspices we, unwearied, won the prize of victory."

Those for whom their mother swells the honeyed milk, (for whom) Aditi, (like) unbounded heaven, massive as a stone, (swells) the beestings, those whose gusts are hymns, bullishly bearing, rich in property— applaud those Ādityas—for well-being. Having their eyes on men, unblinking, as their due the gods have achieved lofty immortality. Having light as their chariot, snake-sly, blameless, they wear the height of heaven as their garment—for well-being. The very strong sovereign kings who have come to the sacrifice, who, undeviating, have established their own dwelling in heaven— seek to entice them here with reverence, with well-turned (hymns)—the great Ādityas and Aditi—for well-being. Who brings to success for you the praise that you will enjoy, all you gods of Manu, however many you are? Who will properly prepare for you, powerfully born ones, the ceremony that will carry us across difficult straits—for well-being? You for whom Manu, with his fire kindled by mind, along with the seven Hotars, first attracted Hotrā (Libation) with sacrifice, you Ādityas, hold out fearlessness as shelter. Make easy passages, easy pathways for us—for well-being. The forethoughtful counselors who are masters of the world, of everything stationary and moving— o gods, rescue us today from transgression done or not done—for well-being. In the raids we call on Indra easy to call, on the divine race of good action that releases from difficult straits, on Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa, Bhaga, for winning, on Heaven and Earth, the Maruts—for well-being. Upon Earth of good protection and faultless Heaven, upon Aditi of good shelter, of good guidance, (as) upon a divine boat with good oars, without defect, not leaking, may we mount—for well-being. All you worthy of the sacrifice, speak for us, for help; rescue us from the crooked ill-going way. With an invocation to the gods that comes true we would invoke you as you listen, o gods, for aid—for well-being. Away with disease, away with all lack of oblation, away with the ill-met hostility of the malicious. Gods, keep hatred at a distance from us. Extend broad shelter to us— for well-being. Every mortal thrives unharmed and is propagated with progeny forth from his foundation, whom, o Ādityas, you lead with your good leading across all difficult passages—for well-being. Which one, o gods, you help at the contest for prizes, which one, o Maruts, you help at the contest of champions when the stake is set, that early-traveling, winning chariot, which suffers no harm, might we mount, o Indra—for well-being. Well-being for us on the pathways and in the wastelands, well-being in the waters, in the precinct of the sun, well-being for us in the wombs at the making of sons—well-being confer (on us) for wealth, o Maruts. For it is just well-being that is best on the path forward—that, (already) rich in inheritance, sets out toward something valuable. Let it keep guard over us at home and in a foreign place; with the gods as its herdsmen let it be easy of access. In just this way has the son of Plati of inspired thought strengthened you, all you Ādityas and Aditi. The over-mastering superior men, the divine race, has been praised by Amartya Gaya."

Our trackers follow their track and fly to (all) directions. No dispenser of mercy other than them is found. My desires have fastened upon the gods.

How will the powerfully roaring poet Br̥haspati grow strong, through what hymn with its well-twisted (ornaments)? Let Aja Ekapād with the chanters who are easy to call, let Ahi Budhnya harken to my call. Or, o Aditi, at the birth of the skillful one [=Agni] under your commandment, will you seek to entice here the two kings Mitra and Varuṇa? (Or will it be) Aryaman, whose path is not to be transgressed, who possesses many chariots, who possesses seven Hotars, at his births in diverse forms? Let the steeds who heed the call heed our call—all the prizewinners of measured pace, who by themselves win thousands as if at the winning of wisdom, the ones who have greatly borne away for themselves the spoils in the encounters. Set in front with your praises Vāyu, who hitches up the chariot, Plenitude, and Pūṣan, for comradeship, for at the impulsion of god Savitar they follow his will—those of one mind (follow the will) of him who is of one mind (with them). The thrice seven flowing rivers, the great waters, the trees, the mountains, and Agni do we call upon for help— and upon the archers in their seat—Kr̥śānu, Tiṣya (the Dog Star), and Rudra the Rudrian among the Rudras. Sarasvatī, Sarayu, Sindhu with their waves—let the great strengthening ones come here greatly with their help— the divine waters, the sweetening mothers. Sing their ghee-rich, honey-rich milk for us. And let the mother Br̥haddivā hear our speech, and Tvaṣṭar with the divine ones, (namely) the Wives (of the Gods), and the Father, R̥bhukṣan, Vāja, Lord of the Chariot, Bhaga. Let the delightful laud of the one who labors protect us— Delightful to the sight like a peaceful dwelling abounding in food. Auspicious is the praise invocation of the Rudras, the Maruts. May we be glorious among the peoples with our cows. May we always be accompanied by refreshment, o gods. The insight that you gave me—you gods, Maruts, Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra— make it swell like a milk-cow with milk. Surely you will convey the hymns on your chariot? Surely in some way you will take notice of this common birth of ours, Maruts? At the navel where we first come together, there let Aditi establish our relationship. For Heaven and Earth, the two great mothers, the goddesses worthy of the sacrifice, proceed by virtue of their kinship with the gods. Both support both (breeds [=gods and men]) with their supports, and with the Fathers they sprinkle much seed. Hotrā (Libation) reaches through to everything of value—as do Br̥haspati and Aramati [/Devotion], the very admirable. Where the honey-pressing pressing-stone is given lofty voice, the inspired thinkers have bellowed with their thoughts. In just this way the powerfully roaring poet, knowing the truth, seeking goods, desiring goods, the inspired Gaya here with hymns and compositions has swelled the divine races. In just this way has the son of Plati of inspired thought strengthened you, all you Ādityas and Aditi. The overmastering superior men, the divine race, has been praised by Amartya Gaya."

The daughter of Pavīru, Thunder, and Aja Ekapad, the supporter of heaven, the river, and the waters of the sea— all the gods will hear my words: (they and also) Sarasvatī, along with insights [/Dhī] and with plenty [/Puraṃdhī].

Pronouncing the truth, thinking straight, the sons of heaven, the heroes of the lord, the Aṅgirases, establishing their inspired word [/laying their inspired track], pondered the first foundation of the sacrifice. Along with his comrades, who were constantly gabbling like geese, while he was throwing open the fastenings made of stone, while he kept roaring to the cows, Br̥haspati both started the praise song and struck up the melody, as knowing one. With two (gates) below, with one above, the cows standing hidden in the fetter of untruth— Br̥haspati, seeking light in the darkness, brought up the ruddy ones, for he opened up the three (gates). Having split apart the stronghold (from front) to back, (having split apart) the lairs, at one blow he cut out the three [=dawn, sun, cow] from the reservoir. Br̥haspati found the dawn, the sun, the cow, (found) the chant while he was thundering like heaven. Indra cut apart Vala, the guard over the milkers, with a roar like a tool. Seeking the milk-mixture with (his comrades) anointed with sweat, he made the niggard wail: he stole the cows. With his trusty comrades blazing, with the winners of spoils, he cleaved apart the cow-nurturer. The Lord of the Sacred Formulation reached through to the treasure with his bulls, his boars, with their hot sweat [/sweating over the gharma pot]. With trusty mind begging the cowherd for the cows, they compelled him with their insightful thoughts. Br̥haspati loosed the ruddy ones upward, with his own yokemates who protect each other from fault. With our propitious thoughts strengthening him, ever roaring in his seat like a lion, we would celebrate Br̥haspati the bull, victorious at the contest of champions, victorious in every raid, When he won the prize of all forms and mounted to heaven, to the higher seats. Br̥haspati the bull (would we celebrate), strengthening him—though each (of us) brings light with our mouth in our own way. Make our hope come true, our hope for the conferring of vigor. For you help even the weakling in your own ways. Let all slighters be off, be behind (us). You two world-halves, who set all in motion, hear this.

When, in the mind’s quickness that is fashioned in the heart, brahmins perform the sacrifice together as companions, then they leave behind some by their knowing ways and others range widely with their lauds and formulations. Who move neither close nor far away, who are not brahmins, and who do not perform in the soma-pressing, they, having fallen upon speech in a bad way, stretch streams of water as their warp-thread, producing nothing. All his companions rejoice with a companion who has come in glory, who is overpowering in the assembly, for, rescuing them from their errors and winning sustenance for them, he is fittingly spurred onward to the competition. The one [=Hotar] sits, blooming a blooming of verses; the other [=Udgātar] sings a song in śakvarī verses. The one, the formulator [=Brahman], speaks the knowledge born (in him), and the other [=Adhvaryu] measures out the measure of the sacrifice."

In the first generation of the gods, what exists was born from what does not exist. The regions of space were born following that (which exists)—that (which exists) was born from the one whose feet were opened up. The earth was born from the one whose feet were opened up; from the earth the regions of space were born. From Aditi, Dakṣa was born, and from Dakṣa, Aditi. Because Aditi was born—she who is your daughter, o Dakṣa— following her, the gods were born, the auspicious kin of the immortal one. When, o gods, well clasped to one another, you stood there in the ocean, then the bitter dust [=spray] dispersed from you, like (the dust [=sweat?]) of those dancing. When, o gods, just as the Yatis did, you swelled the living worlds, then you brought here the sun, which was hidden in the sea. Eight are the sons of Aditi, which were born from her body. With seven she went forth to the gods. She cast away the one stemming from a dead egg. With seven sons Aditi went forth to the ancient generation. For procreation but also for death, she brought here again the one stemming from a dead egg."

In the same way—swiftly—you drive to the sacrifice; convey the Nāsatyas hither for fellowship. Indra, you made fast thousands in the wife of the good one [=impregnated her?]; the Aśvins gave bounties, o champion.

Because with these (wiles of his) he came right up to the Dasyu [=Namuci], to his wiles, he scattered forth darkening mists and darkness.

You went with your lofty, avid comrades; at one blow you smashed his heart’s foundations. You smote Namuci who sought combat, rendering the Dāsa without wiles, for the seer. You made the paths comfortable for Manu, as if they went straightaway to the gods. You have fulfilled your names completely; showing mastery, you have taken (them) in your fist. The gods cheer you on in your vast power. You turned the wooden things [=chariots?] topsy-turvy, When his wheel was sunk down in the waters.

He becomes ever new as he is born; as beacon of the days he goes at the forefront of the dawns. He portions out their share to the gods as he comes here. The Moon extends his lifetime long. Lovely with kimśuka flowers, (made of) śalmali wood, having all forms, of golden color, well-turning, well-wheeled— mount, o Sūryā, the world of immortality. Make your wedding procession a comfortable place for your husband. “Rise up from here, for this woman has a husband.” I call on Viśvāvasu with reverence, with hymns. “Seek some other girl sitting in (the house of) her father, adorned (for marriage) [/smeared (with menstrual blood)]. That is your share by nature. Know this.” “Rise up from here, Viśvāvasu.” With reverence we invoke you. “Seek some other burgeoning maiden. Send the wife to join with her husband.” Let the paths be straight and harmless to men, by which the comrades go to the wooing. Aryaman and Bhaga should lead us all together. Let the united household be easy to hold fast, o gods. I release you from the fetter of Varuṇa, with which well-disposed Savitar bound you. In the womb of truth, in the world of the well-performed (sacrifice?) I place you unharmed along with your husband. I release (her) from here, not from yonder. I have made her well bound yonder, so that, o Indra the rewarder, this woman here will have good sons, good fortune. Let Pūṣan lead you from here, having taken you by the hand. Let the Aśvins convey you forth in their chariot. Go to the house, so that you will be mistress of the house. Exerting your will you will announce the ceremonial distribution. Here let your heart’s desire be realized through children; here in this house be vigilant for the ruling of your household. With this husband merge your body. Then (even) as an elderly couple you two will announce the ceremonial distribution. It [=bride’s garment] becomes dark red. [She=bride] becomes witchcraft, a noose. She is smeared (with blood). Her relatives are elated; her husband is bound in bonds. Hand over the stained garment; to the brahmins parcel out the goods. She herself has become walking witchcraft: the wife enters her husband. His body loses its splendor—glistening in that evil way— when the husband is about to put on his own member the “garment” of the bride. The diseases from the people that follow after the glittering wedding procession of the bride, those let the gods worthy of the sacrifice lead back again whence they came. Let highwaymen who lie in wait not find the married couple. Let them cross over the hard place by easy roads. Let hostilities run away. Of good omen is this bride here: together approach her, behold her. Having given good luck to her, then scatter away home. This is rough; this is sharp, barbed, poisonous: it is not for eating. The brahmin who would know Sūryā, only he deserves this thing associated with the bride(groom). Carving up, carving open, and then cutting apart: behold the forms of Sūryā! But the brahmin makes them clean. I grasp your hand for good fortune, so that with me as your husband you will reach old age. Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitar, Plenitude—(all) the gods—have given you to me for the ruling of the household. Pūṣan, rouse her, most kindly disposed—(she) in whom humans scatter their seed, (she) who will willingly spread apart her thighs for us, (she) in whom we can willingly thrust our penis. To you at first they conveyed Sūryā along with her wedding procession. Give the wife back to her husbands, Agni, along with progeny. Agni has given the wife back, along with lifetime and luster, (to him) who as her husband will live, long-lived, through a hundred autumns. Soma acquired (you) first; the Gandharva acquired (you) next. Agni was your third husband. The fourth was human-born. Soma gave (her) to the Gandharva; the Gandharva gave (her) to Agni. Agni has given both wealth and sons to me, and also this woman here. Stay just here, (you two); don’t go apart. Attain your entire lifespan, playing with your sons and grandsons, rejoicing in your own house. Let Prajāpati generate progeny for us. Let Aryaman anoint (you?) till old age. Without ill-omen enter the world of your husband. Be weal for our two-footed, weal for our four-footed. Be free from the evil eye, not husband-smiting, kindly to the livestock, of good mind and good luster, hero-bearing, god-loving, comfortable. Be weal for our two-footed, weal for our four-footed. Make this woman here, o Indra the rewarder, possessed of good sons and of good fortune. Confer ten sons on her: make her husband the eleventh. Become sovereign queen over your father-in-law; become sovereign queen over your mother-in-law. Become sovereign queen over your sister-in-law, sovereign queen over your brothers-in-law. Let all the gods jointly and jointly the waters anoint our two hearts. Together Mātariśvan, together the Disposer, together the Director—let them join us two together."

Encircle (them) in the midspace, o king, and set upon the sorcerers altogether with your fangs.

When now you see him standing still or moving about, o Agni Jātavedas, or flying along the paths in the midspace, as archer pierce him with your missile, sharpening it. And, Jātavedas, with your spears recover what was seized, from the sorcerer who seized it. Constantly blazing in front, o Agni, smite him down. Let the mottled vultures that eat raw meat eat him. Proclaim here, o Agni, whichever is the one who is the sorcerer who does this. Seize him with your firebrand, o youngest one. Make him subject to the eye of the one with his eye on men.

Pound away those who have fools for gods with your flame and away those who steal life, ever blazing against them. Let the gods pound away the crooked man today, and let his harsh curses come back on him. Let their missiles reach the man thieving with speech at his vulnerable spot. Let the sorcerer meet the onslaught of every (god). The sorcerer who anoints himself with the bloody flesh of men, who (does so) with horseflesh, who carries off the milk of the fertile cow—chop off their heads with your blaze, o Agni.

Whoever seeks to gorge himself on [/steal] the beestings, with your flame pierce him face-to-face in his vulnerable spot, o Agni. Let the sorcerers drink cows’ poison. Let those of evil ways be cut down before Aditi [/Innocence]. Let the god Savitar hand them over. Let them be despoiled of their portion of plants.

Let them not escape your divine lance. Guard us from below and from above, Agni, from behind and from in front. Let these unaging, hottest (flames) of yours, ever blazing, burn against the man who speaks evil. From behind, from in front, from below, and from above—as a poet with your poetic skill protect us all around, o king. O comrade, (protect) your comrade, as an unaging one (protect him to attain) old age. O Agni, as an immortal (protect) us who are mortal. We would set you, the inspired poet, all around (us) as our fortress, o mighty Agni, displaying bold color every day, smiter of (the demonic powers) along with their wreckage— With poison (smite) them along with their wreckage. Burn against the demons with your sharp flame, Agni, and with your spears with their scorching tips. Burn against the pair of sorcerers, the two worm-eaters.

For him to bear and support the world, the gods spread out (the world) by their autonomous power. The world was swallowed and hidden away by darkness; (then) the sun became manifest when Agni was born. The gods, Earth and Heaven, and the waters and plants took pleasure in the fellowship of this one, of him. Now urged on by the gods worthy of the sacrifice, I shall praise Agni, unaging and lofty, who with his radiance stretches through earth and this heaven, through the two world-halves and the midspace. He who was the first Hotar, delightful to the gods, whom they anointed with melted butter upon choosing him (as priest), he made what flies and what goes (on foot), the still and the moving, to wax strong—Agni Jātavedas. When, o Agni Jātavedas, you stood at the head of the world together with your light, we spurred you on with thoughts, songs, and recitations. You became worthy of the sacrifice as the one filling the two world-halves. Agni becomes the head of the world by night; thence is the sun born, rising early in the morning. (Behold) this artful contrivance of those worthy of the sacrifice, that the swift one pursues his work, knowing the way. He who shone brightly, beautiful to see in his greatness when fully kindled, the radiant one whose womb is in heaven— in him, in Agni did all the gods, the protectors of bodies, pour the oblation with well-spoken speech. The gods first begot well-spoken speech, after that the fire [/Agni], after that the oblation. This became their sacrifice, the protector of bodies. That does Heaven know, that does Earth, that the waters. The fire [/Agni] whom the gods begot, in whom all beings poured oblations, aiming straight, he heated earth and this heaven with his flame in his greatness. For with a praise song, with their powers the gods begot in heaven the fire [/Agni] that fills the world-halves. And, for the sake of the world, they made him threefold. He ripens the plants of all forms. When the gods worthy of the sacrifice set him in heaven as the Sun, the son of Aditi, when the wandering pair [=Sun and Moon?] came into existence, only after that did all living beings see in front of (them). For the sake of the whole world the gods made Agni Vaiśvānara the beacon of the days. He who extends through the radiant dawns uncovers the darkness as he goes with his flame. The gods, poets worthy of the sacrifice, begot unaging Agni Vaiśvānara, the primordial star, wandering but not confounding (the divine commandments), the mighty and lofty overseer of the wondrous apparition. With mantras we address the poet Agni Vaiśvānara shining everywhere, the god who by his greatness encompasses the two wide (worlds) from below and from above. I have heard from the forefathers that there are two routes, (that of) the gods and (that of) mortals. Along those two everything that moves goes together, whatever is between the father [=Heaven] and the mother [=Earth]. Conjoined, the two carry the one that wanders, born from the head, stroked by mind. He stands facing all beings: not keeping his distance, as, gleaming, he makes his transit. When the lower [/nearer] one and the higher [/farther] one debate with each other, (they ask) “Of the two leaders of the sacrifice, which of us two knows it through and through?” Have our comrades been able to achieve joint revelry? Have they realized the sacrifice? Who can proclaim this here? “How many fires are there and how many suns? How many dawns, and how many waters? O forefathers, I am not saying something two-faced to you: o poets, I am asking you in order to know.” For as long as the fine-feathered (mares [=flames?]) clothe themselves as if in the face of Dawn, o Mātariśvan, for that long the Brahmin establishes (the fire), approaching the sacrifice and taking his seat near to the Hotar."

(As) the sun (turns) around the wide expanses, Indra should cause to turn here, like chariot wheels, the one [=the sun?] that like a busy surge never stands still. He has smashed the black shades of darkness with his flaring. Chant to him in the same old way a new sacred formulation that never turns away, without equal on earth and in heaven— to Indra, who has distinguished the races of the stranger, like the (straight and crooked) backs (of horses), and need not seek (further for) a comrade. For Indra I have raised my songs, (like) waters in restless surges from the depths of the sea, for him who propped asunder earth and heaven with his powers, like wheels with an axle. He who provides battle fury in his drink, whose first impression is sharp, the boisterous, vehement one with his arrows, who possesses the silvery drink— Soma! All the bushes and trees have not deceived Indra as near-equivalents (of soma). (To him [=Indra]), of whom neither heaven and earth, nor the dry land, nor the midspace, nor the mountains (are the equal), soma has flowed. When his battle fury is being drawn forth, he cleaves the hard and shatters the firm. He smote Vr̥tra, like an axe the trees. He shattered the fortresses. He dug channels as if for rivers. He split the mountain, just like a new pot. Together with his own yokemates, Indra made the cows his own. It’s just you, Indra, who are the insightful requiter of debts. As a knife does joints, you cleave the crooked (ways of those) who violate the ordinances of Mitra and Varuṇa, as people violate a bound alliance. Those of evil ways who transgress against Mitra [/an alliance] and against Aryaman, against agreements and against Varuṇa— grind your bulging bullish ruddy weapon of death down on those without alliance (to us), o bullish Indra. Indra is master of heaven and Indra of earth, Indra of the waters and Indra of the mountains, Indra of the strong and Indra of the wise; Indra is to be called upon in peace and Indra in war. Indra, the strong, projects beyond the nights and beyond the days, beyond the midspace and beyond the wellspring of the sea, beyond the spreading of the wind and beyond the end of the earth, beyond the rivers and beyond the settlements. Like the beacon of the ever-blazing dawn, let your insatiable missile go rolling forth, Indra. Like a stone being launched from heaven, pierce with your hottest weapon those whose alliances are deceitful. The months gave way to (him), the trees gave way, the plants gave way, the mountains gave way; the two world-halves eagerly gave way to Indra; the waters gave way to him as he was being born. When will vengeance be yours, Indra, such that you will rend the demonic power of the evil one, which besets (us), and that those who bloody their allies will lie there like cows at slaughter, in the same way as (Vr̥tra), embracer of the earth? Those who, seeking to rival us, have battered at us, being greatly arrogant and powerful, o Indra— let those without alliance (to us) keep company with blind darkness. The nights with their good lights should prevail over them. Because the many soma-pressings of the peoples and the sacred formulations of the singing seers exhilarate you, heeding this common call, with your help drive nearby, across all (others) as they chant. In just this way, Indra, might we know your new favors that bring benefits. And with your help, Indra, might we Viśvāmitras know this, as we sing just now at dawn. – For blessing we would invoke bounteous Indra, most manly, at this raid, at the winning of the prize of victory, the strong one who listens, (we would invoke) for help in battles, him who smashes obstacles, the winner of prizes."

The Man alone is this whole (world): what has come into being and what is to be. Moreover, he is master of immortality when he climbs beyond (this world) through food. So much is his greatness, but the Man is more than this: a quarter of him is all living beings; three quarters are the immortal in heaven. With his three quarters the Man went upward, but a quarter of him came to be here again. From there he strode out in different directions toward what eats and what does not eat. From him the Virāj was born; from the Virāj the Man. Upon his birth, he reached beyond the earth from behind and also from in front. When, with the Man as the offering, the gods extended the sacrifice, spring was its melted butter, summer its firewood, autumn its offering. On the ritual grass they consecrated that sacrifice, the Man, born at the beginning. With him the gods sacrificed, (also) the Sādhyas and those who were seers. From that sacrifice, when it was offered in full, the clotted-butter mixture was collected. It [=the sacrifice] was made into the animals: those of the air (and both) those that belong to the wilderness and those that belong to the village. From this sacrifice, when it was offered in full, the verses and chants were born. Meters were born from it. The sacrificial formula—from it that was born. From it horses were born and whatever animals have teeth in both jaws. Cows were born from it. From it were born goats and sheep. When they apportioned the Man, into how many parts did they arrange him? What was his mouth? What his two arms? What are said to be his two thighs, his two feet? The brahmin was his mouth. The ruler was made his two arms. As to his thighs—that is what the freeman was. From his two feet the servant was born. The moon was born from his mind. From his eye the sun was born. From his mouth Indra and Agni, from his breath Vāyu was born. From his navel was the midspace. From his head the heaven developed. From his two feet the earth, and the directions from his ear. Thus they arranged the worlds. Its enclosing sticks were seven; the kindling sticks were made three times seven, when the gods, extending the sacrifice, bound the Man as the (sacrificial) animal. With the sacrifice the gods performed the sacrifice for themselves: these were the first foundations. These, its greatness, accompanied (it) to heaven’s vault, where the ancient Sādhyas and the gods are."

(There) Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa perceive with like mind, and Bhaga and Savitar—(all) possessing refined skill. The rivers go forth with the journeying Rudra; across great Devotion they have run— those with which the earth-circling one [=Parjanya?], going around the broad expanse, constantly rumbling in his belly, besprinkles everything. Busy are the Rudras, the Maruts belonging to all communities, the falcons of heaven, nestlings of the lord. Through them Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman make their observations, and Indra hastening with the hastening gods. Having labored to exhaustion, they have obtained their benefit in Indra, in the sight of the sun, and in the masculine nature of the bull— the bards [=Aṅgirases?] who fashioned as his due the mace, his yokemate, at the sessions [=sacrifices] of men. He [=Indra] brought to a halt even the golden (horses) of the Sun, his very own. Anyone feels fear before Indra the stronger, before the snorting from the belly of the fearsome bull. Day after day the victorious one thunders, unrepellable. With reverence show forth your praise today to Rudra the skillful, who rules over heroes, (and to those [=Maruts]) with whom he, the well-disposed, very helpful, self-glorious one, keeps company—with those of heaven who travel their ways, the avid ones. Because they disseminated their fame to their progeny—Br̥haspati, the bull, and those akin to Soma— the first Atharvan (priest) distributed it through sacrifices. The gods and the Bhr̥gus perceive with like mind through their skills. For Heaven and Earth of abundant seed, Narāśaṃsa, the four-square, Yama, Aditi, god Tvaṣṭar, treasure-giver, the masters of the R̥bhus, Rodasī [/the two World-Halves], the Maruts, Viṣṇu are deserving. And of us, the fire-priests, our sage poet [=Agni?] (is) widely (perceptible). Let Ahi Budhnya listen to his call; let Sun and Moon, the heaven dwellers wandering separately. O you two Nahuṣī [=Manu and Nahus?], through visionary thought and ritual labor take cognizance of this one. Let Pūṣan, belonging to the All Gods, let the Child of the Waters, let Vāyu help us forward to seek our movable (goods=livestock). Chant to Vāta, the lifebreath, all the more. O Aśvins, easy to invoke, hear this on your journey. Him who presides over these fearless clans, the self-glorious one, we hymn with hymns; Aditi without assault, along with all the Wives (of the Gods), and the youthful lord of the night (do I?), the manly minded, (hymn). Here crackles the foremost Aṅgiras [=Agni] from birth. The pressing stones, aloft, look upon the ceremony, (those stones) by which the wide-gazing (soma) became widely extended. The (livestock) pen is well-grounded, the axe in the wooden (tree)."

With these (gods?) protect us from one more powerful; with them protect us when (he is) swollen with strength. At every sacrifice that mortal honors the gods who, of longest fame, seeks to entice them here with benevolent thoughts. O you who have control over them all, the shield of the gods is mighty, for they all possess all might; all are worthy of the sacrifice at the sacrifices. The kings of immortality are gladdening: Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa, and the Earth-Encircler [=Wind?]— and what about Rudra praised of men?—the Maruts, Pūṣan, Bhaga. And for us by night (and by day), o you two of bullish goods [=Aśvins], the Sun and Moon are our joint guides toward the seat of the waters, when in company with them Ahi Budhnya [/the Serpent of the Deep] has been set in the depths. And for us let the two gods, the Aśvins, lords of beauty, let Mitra and Varuṇa make broad space through their domains. He hastens toward great riches, across difficulties as if across wastelands. And to us let the Aśvins, though Rudras, be merciful—and all the gods, the Lord of the Chariot, Bhaga, R̥bhu, Vāja, o Masters of the R̥bhus, the Earth-Encircler, o you who afford all possessions. Craftsmanly is the Master of the R̥bhus [=Indra]; craftsmanly is the exhilarating drink of the one who does honor—(let) your two prizewinning fallow bays (come) hither, as you speed— of the one whose melody is also difficult to surpass, (whose) separate sacrifice is like (a sacrifice) stemming from Manu. Make for us immoderation (of wealth), god Savitar. I will praise (you?) in company with our patrons. Along with his draft-horses, Indra keeps hitching up (wealth) for these (patrons) of ours and keeps hold of “the wheel of the domains” like a rein. On them, o Heaven and Earth, confer great fame reaching to all domains, and on the heroes among us, (and confer) strengthening nourishment for the winning of the prize, strengthening nourishment for victory through wealth. O Indra, inclined toward us, (come?) to this laudation, wherever it may be, for our dominance, mighty one. Always protect (us) for our dominance. Let our acquisition fatten, o good one. This praise of mine for the superior men, the praise whose course is dazzling as if by its stretching to the sun, they have strengthened, as a carpenter strengthens a horse-“conciliator” [=piece of horse tack?], (so) it cannot be budged. They whose (priestly gift) comes rolling, their (priestly gift) is golden, yoked with wealth— (it is) like manly forces when facing the other side, like one whose ends have been accomplished [?] at will. I proclaim this in front of Duḥśīma, Pr̥thavāna, Vena, in front of Rāma the lordly, in front of the patrons who, having yoked five hundred, (sent) them along the path, destined for us, (so that) their (priestly gift) has become widely famed. In addition here and now seven and seventy at once did Tānva assign (to us), at once did Pārthya assign, at once did Māyava assign."

Speak a speech to the pressing stones that are speaking, when, o stones, o mountains, all together you swift ones possessed of soma bear your signal-call, your cry to Indra. They speak as if in hundreds, in thousands. They roar with their golden mouths. Having toiled at their good work, the good workers, the stones, have achieved the eating of the oblation even before the Hotar. They speak; in this way they found the honey. They growl over the cooked flesh. Gnawing at the branch of the reddish tree, the gluttonous bulls have bellowed out to it. They speak loftily by reason of the delighting delightful (soma). Shrieking to Indra, in this way they found the honey. (Fit) to be clasped by the sisters [=fingers], the clever ones have danced, making the earth heed with their trampling. The eagles have raised their speech up to heaven. In their lair the black antelopes have danced vigorously. Down they go downward to the rendezvous with the lower one. They have themselves produced much semen from the sun-bright one. Like powerful draft(-horses), they have held fast, yoked together, the bulls bearing the chariot-poles. When panting and gulping they have bellowed, their snorting sounds like that of chargers. To those who possess ten tracks, ten girthbands, ten yoking cords, ten yokes, ten reins—sing to the unaging ones pulling ten chariot-poles, ten yoked ones [=fingers?]. These swift stones have ten fastening straps. Their delightful harness encircles (them). They have taken as their share the beestings of the pressed somian stalk of the first plant. The soma-eaters kiss the two fallow bays of Indra. Milking the plant, they sit on the cow(hide). Having drunk the somian honey milked by them, Indra grows strong, spreads out, plays the bull. Your plant is a bull. You will certainly not suffer harm. You are always possessed of nourishment, (well-)fed. You are pleasing to him whose ceremony you have enjoyed because of your grandeur, as if because of a richly endowed (daughter, given to him in marriage?), o pressing stones. Drilled or undrilled, you stones are unwearying, unslackened, immortal, unailing, unaging, unbudgeable, very stout, unthirsty, unthirsting. Firmly fixed are your fathers [=mountains] in every age. Desirous of repose, they do not hitch themselves up from their seat. Undecaying, companions of the golden (soma), (like) golden trees, they have made Heaven and Earth listen by their bellowing. Just so do the stones speak at their unhitching, *or on their course they speak with their tramplings—the stones as they drink (the soma) directly. Like grain-producers [=farmers/millstones] strewing seed, strewing their “seed” [=semen] they engorge the soma. They do not diminish him though they gnaw at him. When (the soma) was pressed in the ceremony they raised their voice, like playful (boys) jostling their mother. Unhitch (the stones) that have pressed it and release the inspired thought of the (priest) who has pressed it. Let them roll away, being (now) perceived as (just) stones [/the stones no longer being held in harness]."

This is his gold-colored mace, which is made of metal. The golden (mace/ soma) is eager; the golden one is in his two fists. Brilliant and fair-lipped is he who has as the missile of his battle fury the golden (mace/soma). The golden forms are fixed fast in Indra. Like the beacon in heaven [=sun], the gladdening (mace) has been set in place; the (golden) mace will take wide compass like a golden (racehorse) with its charge.

Rejoice, o plants, since you are blooming and fruitful. Like victorious mares, the sprouts deliver. O mothers, called “plants,” o goddesses, I implore you in this way: “Might I gain a horse, a cow, a garment, (in gaining [=curing]) your very self, o man.” Your seat is in the aśvattha-tree; your nest is made in the parṇa-tree: you will surely get a share in the cow when you will gain [=cure] the man. When the plants have come together, like kings at an assembly, that inspired poet is said to be a healer who smites the demons and banishes affliction. The “horse possessor,” the “soma-possessor,” the “strengthener,” the “overpowering one”— all these plants have I acquired for this (man) here not to be harmed. The unbridled forces of the plants rise up like cows from the cowpen as they seek to gain the stake and your very self, o man. Your mother is the “Restorer” by name, and you all are “Expellers.” You are streambeds [=stalks] with wings [=leaves]. You expel what causes affliction. They have stepped over the fences like a thief over a barricade. The plants have driven forth whatever malady of the body there is. When I take these plants in my hand, invigorating them, the very self of the sickness perishes, as if before being captured alive. Him whose every limb, every joint you slither over, from him thrust aside the sickness, like a mighty (man) lying in the middle.

Let them release me from (the shackle) of a curse, and also from (the shackle) of Varuṇa, and from the shackle of Yama—from every offense against the gods. Flying down from heaven, the plants spoke: “The man whom we will reach (while he is still) alive, that man will not suffer harm.” The many plants, having a hundred appearances, whose king is Soma— of those you are the highest—sufficient for our desire, weal for our heart. You plants whose king is Soma, spread wide along the earth— impelled by Br̥haspati, jointly give heroic power to this one here [=medicinal plant]. Let your digger not suffer harm, nor him for whom I dig you. Let our two-footed and four-footed all be free of affliction. Both those who hear this nearby and those who have gone far into the distance — all of you, having coming together, o sprouts—jointly give heroic power to this one here [=medicinal plant]. The plants come to an agreement with King Soma: “For whom the brahmin acts, him, o king, will we deliver.” You are the highest, o plant. The trees are your subordinates.

He knows the three bodies of the blazing one—he who first found success with the priestly gift.

Do battle, you battle-doer [/make joy, you joy-maker] whose impetuous powers are real. Give us a portion of wealth, even in what is (as yet) unapportioned."

Creating his own greatness and Indrian power as he went, upon drinking the soma the resolute one increased. Viṣṇu with his strength (assisted) his [=Indra’s] greatness, having run to the plant [=soma]. It teems with honey. Upon smiting Vr̥tra with the gods [=Maruts] as fellow travelers, bounteous Indra became worthy to be chosen. When, bearing weapons, you stood with Vr̥tra the serpent, for battle, to acquire a laud, all the Maruts together in person there increased your greatness and Indrian power, strong one. On just being born, he thrust aside the challengers. The hero looked forward to his masculine power, to battle. He split the stone; he discharged the flowing streams downward. He propped the broad firmament with his skillful work. Thereupon Indra was entirely master of his powers. He thrust apart more widely heaven and earth. Emboldened [/bristling with excitement], he brought down the metal mace, agreeable to Mitra and to pious Varuṇa. The teeming ones [=Maruts] hastened there for the powers of Indra, for the battle fury of the mettlesome one, when the strong one split apart Vr̥tra with strength—Vr̥tra, who was holding the waters but was himself enclosed by darkness. The two who together approached the heroic deeds first to be performed, taking their (battle) places with their great powers— smoky darkness dusted down on (the one), when he was smashed. Indra by his greatness became lord over the early invocation. All the gods then increased your bullish powers with eloquence accompanied by soma. He ate the serpent Vr̥tra subdued by Indra’s blow, as fire does dry food with his jaws. With skillful words accompanied by chants, by reason of your (acts of) comradeship (for him), proclaim the many (acts of) comradeship (for us). Indra is famed as subjugating Dhuni and Cumuri for Dabhīti by reason of his [=Dabhīti’s] mind of trust (in ritual hospitality).

And arranging their meters at the ceremonies, they measure twelve cupfuls of soma. Configuring the four as thirty-six and arranging the meters up to twelve (syllables?), having measured out the sacrifice with their inspired thought, the poets make the chariot [=sacrifice] roll forth with r̥c and sāman [/verse and tune]. Fourteen are the other powers of this one [=chariot of the sacrifice]. Seven wise ones [=priests] lead it forth with their speech.

Moreover, the wealth of one who gives does not become exhausted, and the non-giver finds no one to show mercy. Whoever—when a man, weak and broken, has approached desiring nourishment—though he has food, hardens his heart, though he always used to be his friend, he also finds no one to show mercy. Just he is a benefactor who gives to the beggar who, emaciated, goes roaming, desirous of food. He becomes sufficient for him at his pleading entreaty, and he makes him his companion in the future. He is no companion who does not give of his food to a companion, who, being in his company, accompanies him. He should turn away from him; this is not a home. He should seek another who gives, even a stranger. The stronger man should give to one in need. He should look along the longer path, for riches turn like chariot-wheels: they come up to one man after another. The undiscerning man finds food in vain. I speak the truth: it is just a deadly weapon for him. He does not prosper in compatriot, nor in companion. Who eats alone has only evil. It’s just when it plows that a plowshare makes a man well fed. It’s just when he goes that a man “wraps up” the road with his feet. The formulator who speaks is more a winner than the one who doesn’t; a friend who gives would be superior to one who doesn’t. The one-footed [=sun?] has stridden farther than the two-footed [=man?]; the two-footed overtakes the three-footed [=old man?] from behind. The four-footed [=dog?] comes at the call of the two-footed ones as it watches over the fivefold ones [=herds?], staying by them. Two hands, even though the same, do not accomplish the same.

Speeding along the paths in the midspace, he does not settle down on any single day. Comrade of the waters, the first-born abiding by truth—where was he born? from where has he arisen? The breath of the gods, the embryo of the world, this god wanders as he wishes. Only his sounds are heard, not his form. To him, to the Wind, we would do honor with our oblation."
